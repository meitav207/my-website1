          <h2>Story</h2>
          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>Demon and his brother Damien were born to a demon father and a human mother in Tynerum, the harsh and
            unforgiving home
            of the demon race, where the strong ruled on top and the weak were broken. The pure-blood demons of Tynerum
            once
            attempted to take the powers of a Transcendent, but their failure transformed their world into a barren
            wasteland. The
            Demon's father spoke out against the twisted experiments and was banished as a result, leaving the Demon to
            protect his
            mother and brother alone.

            The Demon, having taken after his father, was born with wings and a body suited for his demon powers. In
            contrast,
            Damien had taken heavily after his mother, meaning that he had been born with a human body. As such, he had
            no
            demon
            powers or wings, despite his father's demon blood running through his veins. He was blind in his left eye
            and
            he had a
            sickly disposition, resulting in the pure-blood demons of Tynerum tormenting him frequently.

            On one such occasion, the Demon witnessed the pure-bloods attacking Damien and threatening to attack his
            mother next,
            claiming that they would put her in her place for daring to live in Tynerum as a human. The Demon's fury
            caused his
            powers to awaken, which he used to destroy the pure-bloods attacking his brother.

            Realizing that Tynerum was no longer safe, the Demon took his mother and Damien to Maple World, where they
            settled in
            southern Leafre. Over the years, Damien grew to idolize his brother and wished to become as strong as him.
            Some time
            after moving to Leafre, the Demon learned that Damien wanted to see the snow, and so he took his family to
            El
            Nath,
            where he bought Damien a red scarf, which the young boy excitedly decided to wear for the rest of his life.
          </p>

          <h3>Serving Under the Black Mage</h3>
          <p>The Demon would later become a Commander of the Black Mage in exchange for protection and immunity for
            Damien
            and his
            mother, setting up a home in southern Minar Forest. While in the Valley of the Dragons, he met and rescued a
            pure-blood
            demon named Mastema from a horde of dragons. In exchange, Mastema pledged her eternal loyalty to the
            Demon.[8]

            Over the years, the Demon became the Black Mage's most reliable Commander, much to the jealousy of Arkarium.
            In the last
            days of the war, the Black Mage and his Commanders prepared to siege to the Temple of Time.

            During the battle, the Demon confronted a wounded Temple Keeper and told her that she was the last one left.
            Claiming
            that the Black Mage would seal her Goddess away, he asked her to surrender rather than throw her life away
            in
            vain. The
            Temple Keeper refused and foretold that the Demon would soon find himself in the same situation as her, to
            have his
            loved ones killed just as a means for someone else to fulfill their goals.

            Undeterred by her words, the Demon struck her down before proceeding to confront Rhinne. Arkarium then
            completed his
            betrayal of the Goddess by blinding her, while the Demon stunned her in place, allowing the Black Mage to
            steal her
            Transcendent powers. He then used the power of time to seal both Rhinne and her child into a different
            dimension.

            Despite Arkarium's contributions to the fight, the Black Mage deliberately gave full credit to the Demon for
            securing
            the Temple of Time, causing Arkarium to seethe with jealousy. While the Demon rested after the battle, the
            Black Mage
            ordered the other Commanders to destroy the rest of Ossyria. Arkarium went to the southern region of Leafre,
            where he
            attacked the Demon's family and killed his mother. This caused Damien's latent demon powers to awaken,
            resulting in the
            destruction of their home.

            Impressed by his power, Arkarium convinced Damien to join him by claiming that it was Damien's awakening
            that
            had
            resulted in his mother's fatal wounds. He presented an illusion of Damien's mother preserved in time and
            explained that
            only a Transcendent had the power to revive the dead.

            However, he also claimed that the Black Mage would have full control over the new Transcendent of Time after
            Rhinne and
            suggested that they could turn back time to revive his mother, but only if Damien swore his loyalty to the
            Black Mage.
            With Damien as his underling, Arkarium hoped to use him as insurance against the Demon.</p>

          <h3>Betrayal and Revenge</h3>
          <p>During a meeting with Arkarium, Von Leon, and Orchid, Arkarium mentioned the Black Mage commanding the
            destruction of
            southern Minar Forest. The Demon rushed to his home, only to discover that it was in flames. Furious that
            the
            Black Mage
            had broken his promise to leave his family alone, the Demon stormed into the Temple of Time. After running
            into Mastema,
            he ordered her to deliver a letter to the Heroes that outlined his betrayal, as well as logistics of the
            troop
            deployment in the Temple of Time.

            The Demon then headed to the Black Mage's throne room, but was stopped by Arkarium outside the door. When
            Arkarium
            refused to step aside, the Demon began fighting against him. Before they could unleash their full power, the
            Black Mage
            opened the doors to allow the Demon entry, after which Arkarium left to go hunt down the Heroes. The Demon
            engaged in a
            fierce battle with the Black Mage and managed to destroy his protective barrier, but he was ultimately no
            match for his
            former master.</p>

          <h2>Main Story</h2>
          <h3>Joining the Resistance</h3>
          <p>In order to survive, the Demon sealed himself inside a protective egg, in which he hibernated for
            centuries.
            Eventually,
            this egg was discovered by the Black Wings, who brought it back to Edelstein. Realizing that the egg
            contained
            an
            enormous amount of power, they took it back to the Verne Mine and hooked it up to a special Energy
            Conducting
            Device in
            order to power Gelimer's experiments.

            As the device began to drain his energy, the Demon awoke from his hibernation and quickly broke out of the
            egg, using
            the last of his strength to defeat the Black Wings henchmen operating the device. In the shadows, J watched
            in
            amazement
            at the Demon's tremendous powers. As the Demon fell unconscious, J took him back to the Secret Plaza.

            The Demon soon awoke in the infirmary room and realized that all of his power had been drained away. He then
            overheard J
            telling the Resistance leaders about his discovery of the Energy Conducting Device, which he described as
            being similar
            to the one in the Power Plant, except that it had been connected to the egg. He explained that the Demon was
            extremely
            powerful, and that he wouldn't have brought him back to the Secret Plaza if the Demon hadn't already
            expended
            the last
            of his strength.

            Elex wondered whether the Demon was one of Gelimer's test subjects, which would make him a victim of the
            Black
            Wings,
            just like Vita. J went to check on the Demon in the infirmary and found him awake. He then escorted the
            Demon
            to meet
            with the Resistance leaders, who began questioning him about his organization, his background, and the wings
            on his
            back. The Demon explained that he was a former Commander of the Black Mage, and that he had been born with
            his
            wings, as
            his father was a pure-blood demon.

            Claudine was shocked and asked the Demon how he could be a former Commander when the Black Mage had been
            sealed for
            centuries. This, in turn, shocked the Demon, who realized that not only had the Heroes succeeded in
            defeating
            his former
            master, but quite a large amount of time had passed since then. Claudine asked the Demon why he had betrayed
            the Black
            Mage, but the Demon merely told her that it was a personal matter.

            He then asked Claudine who the Resistance and the Black Wings were, to which she explained that the
            Resistance
            was an
            organization formed to drive the Black Wings, a group trying to revive the Black Mage, out of Edelstein. The
            Demon was
            pleased to know that the Black Mage may yet return, as it meant that he could finally get his revenge. Just
            then,
            Headmaster Ferdi appeared and asked him to join the Resistance, as they both had a common enemy. After
            considering it,
            the Demon decided to accept their offer and thanked them for rescuing him.</p>

          <h3>Fury or Vengeance</h3>
          <p>Back in the infirmary, the Demon began wondering about whether he felt comfortable using the same power
            that
            he had once
            used to serve the Black Mage, or whether he should view his power drainage as an opportunity to cultivate a
            new
            power.</p>

          <h3>Helping the Resistance</h3>
          <p>Having awakened his old power, he returned to Claudine, who recommended that he enroll in Headmaster
            Ferdi's
            training
            program in order to get stronger. After passing the training courses, Claudine told him that a Black Wings
            spy
            had
            infiltrated the Secret Plaza. With everyone on high-alert, the Demon decided to find the spy himself. The
            spy
            was
            surprised that the Demon had found him, as he had been using the power of darkness to cloak himself. The
            Demon
            explained
            that his demon bloodline allowed him to see through such tricks and proceeded to easily dispatch him, much
            to
            Claudine's
            impressment.

            The Demon then continued training in Edelstein until he was contacted by Checky, who told him that two
            children had gone
            missing from the town. He was worried that the children had ended up in the Serpent Path and asked the Demon
            to find
            them. Sure enough, the Demon found the two children cowering in fear of the serpents in the area. He then
            defeated the
            serpents in order to clear a path, allowing the children to run home safely.

            Some time later, the Demon realized that he needed new armor and went to ask Surl about obtaining some. Surl
            began
            complaining that people nowadays didn't understand the value of saving, explaining that many people threw
            away
            Black
            Plastic Bags from the Dust Box monsters without even realizing how many useful things were inside. In
            exchange
            for
            bringing him some of those plastic bags, he agreed to give the Demon a fair price on some armor. After the
            Demon
            collected the bags, Surl used the materials inside them to craft new gloves for him.

            Soon after, Claudine told him that there were too many Streetlight monsters around Edelstein, which made it
            difficult
            for the Resistance to conduct their operations at night. As the Demon began heading to Streetlight Row, he
            encountered
            Council President Anthony, who also told him that there were too many Streetlights, and that the city needed
            to cut down
            on power consumption. Anthony ordered him to eliminate the Streetlights and bring back their light bulbs
            directly to
            him. The Demon realized that Anthony was planning to turn a profit with them, but nevertheless, he
            eliminated
            the
            Streetlights and gave the bulbs to Anthony, who bought his silence by giving him a single bulb.</p>

          <h3>Second Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>As the Demon continued his training, Elex reached out to him and asked if he would investigate a strange
            monster that
            was scaring the townspeople. In Edelstein Park, the Demon encountered a purple cat, which immediately began
            attacking
            him. While fighting, the cat sensed something familiar and unexpectedly began speaking, calling the Demon
            “Commander”.
            She introduced herself as his servant, Mastema, which made him immediately stop fighting. Mastema explained
            that she had
            managed to deliver his letter to the Heroes all those centuries ago, but Arkarium had arrived shortly after
            and attacked
            her. In order to survive, she had transformed herself into a cat and had spent centuries searching for the
            Demon.

            Overjoyed to be reunited with her master, Mastema asked if he remembered the day that they had first met,
            when
            he had
            saved her in the Valley of the Dragons. The Demon told her that he remembered and realized that since no one
            except the
            two of them had been in the valley that day, it meant that the cat really was Mastema. He then told her what
            had
            happened during his battle with the Black Mage, and how he had encased himself into an egg in order to
            recover.

            Mastema filled him in on how after his fight with the Black Mage, the Heroes had managed to defeat the
            Commanders at the
            Temple of Time and seal the Black Mage away. Though she didn't know the fate of the other Commanders, she
            believed that
            they were likely plotting to revive the Black Mage. She also added that the Heroes had disappeared after
            sealing the
            Black Mage, but that there were rumors of their return spreading throughout Maple World. The Demon then
            decided to take
            her back with him to the Secret Plaza under the cover story that she was his pet.

            At the Secret Plaza, Mastema told him that since he needed more power, she could form a contract with him in
            order to
            bestow her demon powers onto him. Though the Demon was hesitant, Mastema assured him that the power transfer
            wouldn't
            turn him into a cat, adding that it would also allow them to speak telepathically. Once the Demon accepted
            the
            contract,
            Mastema's power flooded into him, awakening more of his lost power.</p>

          <h3>The Robed Ones</h3>
          <p>The Demon then left the Secret Plaza and began walking around Edelstein. After sensing that he was being
            watched, he
            made his way to the outskirts of the town, where two robed men appeared. The older man told the younger one
            that it was
            a bad idea to reveal themselves, but the younger man ordered him to be silent. He then told the Demon that
            it
            had been a
            long time since they had last seen each other, and that he had only wanted to stop by in order to say that
            it
            was good
            to see him again.

            After the pair left, the Demon felt that the younger man's voice seemed familiar, but he was puzzled by the
            dark energy
            that he exuded. Mastema telepathically spoke to him through their bond and asked whether she ought to follow
            them. The
            Demon told her not to, as it was too dangerous, and so she decided to instead investigate their identities.
          </p>

          <h3>Meeting Alcaster</h3>
          <p>Soon after, the Demon ventured aboard to continue his training. Some time later, Mastema telepathically
            reached out to
            him and explained that she had heard rumors of an old man named Alcaster in El Nath, and that he had been
            alive for
            centuries. She suggested that he visit Alcaster, as anyone who had lived for so long would likely have
            valuable
            information.

            The Demon arrived in El Nath and approached Alcaster, who immediately sensed the great darkness within him.
            Believing
            him to be a servant of the Black Mage, Alcaster refused to speak with him. Mastema then contacted him and
            asked what he
            had learned from Alcaster, but the Demon told her how Alcaster had refused to speak with him after sensing
            his
            Demon
            Fury.

            Mastema suggested that he help Alcaster in order to prove that he wasn't evil and told him to listen for an
            opportunity.
            The Demon then overheard Alcaster speaking to himself, saying that he needed Stirge Wings for his research,
            though he
            couldn't make the trip all the way to Kerning City himself. Seizing the opportunity, the Demon collected the
            Stirge
            Wings and brought them to Alcaster, promising him that he was no longer in league with the Black Mage.

            Though Alcaster was dubious, he nevertheless accepted the Demon's gift and agreed to hear him out. The Demon
            asked him
            about the other Commanders and the Black Wings, to which Alcaster explained that he only had secondhand
            information
            about the old war from his master, who had personally lived through it. His master had told him that only
            Von
            Leon knew
            the full story of what had happened at the Temple of Time, as well as the fate of the Black Mage, but added
            that the
            Lion King had been hidden for some time.

            Though he didn't know what had happened to the other Commanders, he believed that they remained hidden while
            building
            their forces. He also believed that the Black Wings had been founded by one of the Commanders themselves,
            explaining
            that they were too focused and organized to be a random cult that worshipped the Black Mage. He then asked
            the
            Demon why
            he had asked such questions, as he would have thought that a former Commander would know more about the
            Black
            Mage's
            followers than him. Regardless, he told the Demon to take care if he intended to battle those dark forces.
          </p>

          <h3>Meeting Mercedes</h3>
          <p>After getting his answers, the Demon continued his training and soon made his way to the Six Path Crossway,
            where he ran
            into Mercedes. She immediately recognized him as a Commander, but she also sensed that he seemed different,
            as
            though he
            were aware of his past misdeeds. She told him that thanks to the letter that he had sent all those centuries
            ago, the
            Heroes had been able to formulate their strategy based on the troop deployment information that he had given
            them, which
            had been the key to their victory.

            She also mentioned that Arkarium had appeared and attacked Mastema and the other Heroes soon after she had
            delivered the
            letter before fleeing. With the information from his letter, the Heroes had been able to take the most
            direct
            route to
            the Black Mage's throne room, where they had found the Demon lying unconscious. However, because of his
            attack, the
            Black Mage's protective magic had been damaged, which had been instrumental in allowing them to seal him
            away.

            The Demon was thankful that his actions had been meaningful, but Mercedes pointed out that there was much
            evil
            that he
            had yet to atone for, adding that she doubted that his crimes could ever be forgiven. The Demon replied that
            he had no
            intention of seeking forgiveness. Because he had already lost everything that mattered to him, vengeance was
            the only
            thing left to him.

            Mercedes asked what his intentions were, to which the Demon told her that he would end the Black Mage
            himself
            and right
            all of his wrongs. Mercedes told him that his strength would be needed once the Black Mage returned, and
            that
            she was
            glad that they were on the same side. She also pointed out how strange it was that despite having once been
            sworn
            enemies, they were now able to have a simple conversation. Though she couldn't forgive him, she explained
            that
            she no
            longer hated him, and hoped that the Great Spirit would watch over him until they met again to face the
            Black
            Mage.</p>

          <h3>Third Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>Some time later, Mastema told him that she had found a way to help him regain more of his old power and
            asked
            him to
            come to Edelstein Park, as they needed a secluded area for the training that she had in mind. When the Demon
            arrived,
            Mastema explained that she had created a temporary copy of her past self, and though it wasn't as strong,
            she
            believed
            that sparring with it would help the Demon in his training.

            She then sent him into an alternate dimension, where he fought and defeated the copy of Mastema. Upon
            returning back to
            the real world, Mastema asked whether her copy had told him anything strange, which the Demon denied.
            However,
            he told
            her that he had been able to regain more of his old power, which Mastema was glad to hear.</p>

          <h3>Helping Mastema</h3>
          <p>Some time later, Mastema reached out to the Demon again and excitedly told him that she had found a way to
            change
            herself back to her demon form. She then asked him to collect Cellion, Lioner, and Grupin tails, which could
            restore
            one's true form if braided together. Though the Demon believed that it was merely a tall tale, he
            nevertheless
            brought
            them back for her. Mastema then braided the tails together and placed the braid under her pillow, claiming
            that she
            would return back to normal the next day. However, just as the Demon suspected, the rumor was merely a
            superstition and
            Mastema remained a cat.</p>

          <h3>Demons in Orbis</h3>
          <p>The Demon then continued his training, but soon after, Mercedes reached out to him again and demanded to
            know
            what he
            was planning. The Demon told her that he had no idea what she was talking about, and so Mercedes explained
            that a
            suspicious group of men had been signed in Orbis, and that one of them looked exactly like him. The Demon
            wondered
            whether they were the same men who had been tailing him in Edelstein and told Mercedes that he would look
            into
            it. She
            decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and told him to speak with Lisa, who was the one who had seen
            the
            group.
            She also warned the Demon that she would make him pay if he were truly planning something sinister.

            In Orbis, the Demon met Lisa, who told him that she hadn't personally witnessed the men, but rather, she had
            heard the
            rumor from Spiruna. Lisa warned the Demon that Spiruna hated strangers and suggested that he do something
            for
            her so
            that she would be more inclined to humor him. She suggested that he bring Starpieces from the Star Pixies,
            whose growing
            population had been irritating Spiruna. Sure enough, Spiruna was annoyed to see the Demon, though she was
            placated when
            he gave her the Starpieces. He asked her where the men were headed, but Spiruna told him that he needed to
            do
            more in
            exchange for that information.

            After he hunted Lunar Pixies and Luster Pixies, Spiruna was satisfied and used her magic to teleport him to
            their
            location. There, he witnessed the same robed men putting Eliza, the Goddess' pet, under a curse. The Demon
            quickly
            realized that the men were also demons. As soon as they spotted him, one of the demons decided that they
            needed to
            eliminate him, as he had seen too much.

            However, the younger demon from before, who seemed to be in charge, told him that he would handle the
            situation. He
            ordered them to disperse and finish their missions, but the Demon moved to attack, vowing that he wouldn't
            make the same
            mistake twice. However, the young demon simply told him that they would meet again someday before
            disappearing, leaving
            the Charmed Eliza to fight him.

            After he defeated the Goddess' pet, Eliza thanked the Demon for lifting the curse on him before
            disappearing.
            The Demon
            was surprised that there were still other demons in Maple World, as he believed that they had all vanished
            after the
            Black Mage had been sealed away. He then resolved to investigate their return.</p>

          <h3>Birth of an Alliance</h3>
          <p>Claudine called the Demon and informed him of the Continental Conference, which she asked him to attend as
            a
            member of
            the Resistance. After receiving unanimous confirmations, the First Continental Conference took place and the
            Maple
            Alliance was officially created.

            Investigating the Verne Mine
            Having grown much stronger, the Demon decided that it was time for him to start his investigation on who was
            commanding
            the Black Wings. He first infiltrated the Verne Mine and destroyed the Guard Robots in order to thin their
            numbers.
            Moving deeper into the mine, he defeated the Guard Robot L monsters and created a hole in their monitoring
            of
            Gelimer's
            laboratory.

            However, even after searching the laboratory and the Power Plant, he was unable to find any clues about the
            leader of
            the Black Wings. Just then, he felt a dark energy coming from Eleanor the Black Witch's room. Before
            investigating it,
            however, he decided to first search the rooms of the other officers.

            He began investigating Francis' room and decided to read his diary. As he opened it, overpowering magic
            emanated from
            its pages, nearly causing him to drop it. He was surprised to know that the Black Wings had such
            extraordinarily powered
            members. Flipping through the pages, he read through Francis' lovesick musings on Orchid and even found a
            photo of her
            that Francis had discreetly taken. He realized that Orchid was leading the Black Wings, but he wondered why
            Lotus wasn't
            in the photo, as the two were normally inseparable.</p>

          <h3>The Forbidden Book of Alchemy</h3>
          <p>Some time later, Mastema told the Demon about a new lead that she had discovered, explaining that there was
            a
            secret
            book on Dark Alchemy in Magatia. She told him that she had visited Magatia many years ago, where she had
            heard
            rumors
            about its researchers' hidden alchemy techniques that supposedly allowed them to draw on darkness itself.

            She explained that there were two alchemical societies in Magatia, the Zenumists and the Alcadno, and
            suggested that he
            start by questioning the Zenumist President, Carson. She also told him that she had found another way to
            restore her
            true form through alchemy and asked him to bring her Purple Liquid while he was in Magatia, which would
            allow
            her create
            a potion that could transform her into whatever she most desired.

            In Magatia, the Demon asked Carson about Dark Alchemy at the Zenumist headquarters. Carson was shocked that
            the Demon
            knew of its existence, as the subject was a closely guarded secret. He asked the Demon to reveal his
            identity,
            to which
            the Demon merely replied that he hunted and destroyed dark artifacts of the Black Mage. Carson told him that
            he did know
            about Dark Alchemy, but he explained that someone had just stolen his Forbidden Book of Alchemy.

            He noted that the Demon was different from the ones who had stolen the book and asked how he had heard about
            it, as it
            seemed strange that so many people were looking for it all of a sudden. The Demon explained that as a hunter
            of relics
            connected with the Black Mage, he had followed the rumors of Dark Alchemy to Magatia.

            When the Demon asked what the thieves had done, Carson told him that he wasn't sure who the thieves were,
            but
            their
            magic had been strong enough to stun him, open the safe, and escape. However, he explained that the
            Zenumists
            only had
            half of the book, while the Alcadno held the other half in order to keep the secret safe. He was worried
            that
            if the
            thieves were to steal the other half of the book, they would gain access to Dark Alchemy, and so he asked
            the
            Demon to
            stop them.

            The Demon rushed to the Alcadno headquarters, only to find a magician hypnotizing Maed, the Alcadno
            President,
            into
            giving him the other book. The Demon rushed to attack the magician, who was overwhelmed by the Demon's
            strength. Though
            he managed to get away, the Demon noted that the magician had been injured, and so he couldn't have gotten
            far.

            Carson then arrived and asked Maed what had happened. Maed told Carson that he had been hypnotized into
            giving
            the other
            half of the book to the thief. The Demon then asked what was written in the Forbidden Book of Alchemy, as he
            might be
            able to help. Maed told the Demon that the Forbidden Book of Alchemy contained the most powerful secrets of
            Magatia's
            founder.

            Those who had come after the founder had been told to keep its contents secret at all costs, and so they had
            split the
            book into two. Maed explained that Dark Alchemy wasn't used for attacking or defending, but rather for
            making
            or
            destroying magical substances, adding that it had the power to alter the very flow of Maple World's magic.
            He
            then
            begged the Demon to recover the book.

            Maed gave the Demon a Magic Tracking Compass that would allow him to track the magician's whereabouts. He
            told
            the Demon
            that it seemed that the magician was heading west of Magatia into the desert, warning him that the magician
            would likely
            escape if he made it to Ariant. The Demon rushed after the magician and caught up to him in The Desert of
            Red
            Sand.

            Hiding behind a tree, he watched the magician regroup with two others, one of whom appeared to be their
            leader. The
            leader immediately sensed the Demon's presence and told the magician that he had been followed. As the Demon
            prepared
            himself for battle, the magician warned the leader that the Demon was powerful. Noticing that they had set
            up
            a portal,
            the Demon realized that they were planning to make their escape through it. He threatened them to return the
            book, but
            the magicians refused and told him that they couldn't afford to fail their mission and risk Arkarium's
            wrath.

            This intrigued the Demon, who asked them what Arkarium wanted with the book. Once again, they refused to
            tell
            him,
            though they did mention that the book had originally belonged to the Black Mage. One of the magicians then
            grew careless
            and boasted that they would use Dark Alchemy to destroy all the Seal Stones and revive the Black Mage.

            Having heard all that he needed, the Demon easily dispatched the three magicians and recovered the book. He
            then
            returned to Magatia and gave the book to Maed, explaining that the thieves had been servants of the Black
            Mage, and that
            they would likely return to steal the book. Maed told the Demon that he and Carson had come to an agreement
            to
            destroy
            the book, as it was too dangerous to lose and too difficult to keep safe, which the Demon agreed was the
            wisest choice.
            Still, Maed wondered what the true purpose of Dark Alchemy was and why the founder had left them with such a
            powerful
            and dangerous tome.

            On his way back from Magatia, the Demon picked up some Purple Liquid from a Rurumo for Mastema and returned
            to
            Edelstein. With the Purple Liquid, she created a potion that would allow her to turn into what she most
            desired, but
            after drinking it, Mastema transformed into the Demon from when he had been a Commander. Fortunately for
            her,
            the
            effects of the potion quickly wore off, though the Demon was nevertheless amused.</p>

          <h3>Demons in Ludibrium</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Mastema contacted the Demon with a lead on the demons whom he had met at Orbis, explaining that
            Roly-Poly 10
            had sighted the robed demons in Ludibrium. When the Demon arrived, Roly-Poly 10 immediately began yelling at
            him and
            demanded to know what he had done to the King Block Golems. The Demon asked what Roly-Poly 10 meant, to
            which
            he
            explained that he had sighted the Demon putting a strange device on the King Block Golems.

            The Demon assured him that he wasn't the one responsible for what had happened, and that he was actually
            trying to find
            the culprit. Roly-Poly 10 still didn't believe him and told him to prove that he wasn't the one responsible
            by
            removing
            the MR Receivers placed on the Golems. After the Demon collected the receivers, Roly-Poly 10 decided to
            trust
            him and
            explained that he had asked the Demon to bring the receivers so that he could figure out the assailants'
            location. After
            learning that they were in the Toy Factory, he asked the Demon to stop them.

            The Demon arrived at the factory and found two demons talking. The robed demon was wondering if it was wise
            to
            have
            carried out their plan in Ludibrium, as they had been ordered not to waste their time with toys. The unrobed
            demon told
            his comrade to think and asked if he wanted the new Commander to worry about petty details, added that they
            would be
            rewarded for their actions.

            Just then, the Demon revealed himself and demanded to know if they served the Black Mage. The unrobed demon
            was shocked
            to see the Demon and asked how he had found them, to which the robed demon snapped at his comrade about how
            he
            had
            already warned him once before about the dangers of leaving the Demon alive. The unrobed demon told his
            comrade to shut
            up, adding that the Commander didn't need to know about it. Hearing about the new Commander intrigued the
            Demon, much to
            the unrobed demon's embarrassment, as he was supposed to keep it a secret.

            He decided to eliminate the Demon right then and told his comrade to go on without him. Despite the
            Commander's orders,
            he decided that he would put an end to the Demon. However, the Demon defeated the unrobed demon, forcing him
            to retreat.
            The Demon wondered who the new Commander was and resolved to stop them, as he didn't want anyone else to
            suffer as he
            had.

            He wondered if there was anyone he knew who had the qualifications to become a Commander, but since he had
            been asleep
            for centuries, he realized that there was no one that he knew who was alive, and so he decided to ask
            Mastema.
            Mastema
            was surprised that there was a new Commander leading the demons, as she had thought that the demons had left
            Maple World
            after the Black Mage had been sealed away. With no other leads, the Demon decided that he would have to
            investigate
            himself.</p>

          <h3>Fourth Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Mastema reached out to the Demon and asked how his training was going, to which he replied that
            he had hit a
            wall and asked if they could repeat the sparring session he had with her clone. Mastema told him that she
            doubted that
            sparring with her would help and instead suggested that he try sparring with himself.</p>

          <h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
          <p>Mastema explained that though the Temple of Time was normally the only place where one could tinker with
            time, she had
            heard news that something was wrong with time in Ludibrium and suggested that they go to the Path of Time at
            the
            Clocktower Bottom Floor.

            There, Mastema stabilized a crack in time, as her cat form allowed her to move between dimensions, and she
            explained
            that he could use the crack in order to fight his past self. She also assured him that she had arranged it
            so
            that his
            actions in the past wouldn't affect the future. The Demon then entered the Crack in Time and fought his past
            self in the
            Temple of Time.

            As their battle progressed, his past self soon resorted to using his most powerful skills. Nevertheless, the
            Demon was
            able to successfully defeat his past self and returned to Mastema. He told her that fighting with his past
            self had
            allowed him to remember many of the skills that he had forgotten, and so the training had been a success.
          </p>

          <h3>Demon Avenger</h3>
          <p>Mastema suggested that he fight his inner rage and used her power to send him inside himself, similar to
            meditation.
            However, she warned him that the damage he sustained there would transfer to his real body. The Demon was
            then
            sent to
            the memory of his ruined home, where he defeated his inner rage and achieved new power.</p>

          <h3>The Trap</h3>
          <p>Some time later, the Demon received a strange letter written in an archaic style. The author had written
            that
            they knew
            that the Demon was looking for information about the Black Mage's newest Commander and told him that they
            could provide
            it if he came alone to the West Leafre Forest. The Demon realized that it was an obvious trap, but since it
            was also an
            opportunity to gather information about the enemy, he decided to go anyway. He entered the forest, where he
            called for
            the author of the letter to show themselves.

            A demon officer then appeared and claimed that the Demon was either brave or foolish for having come while
            knowing that
            it was a trap. The Demon replied to him that it was his chance to uncover information. The officer told him
            that he knew
            that leaving the Demon alone would become a problem for the Commander, to which the Demon asked who the
            Commander was
            and why demons like the officer were serving them. The officer replied that there was no point in telling
            him,
            as he
            wouldn't live much longer. However, the Demon managed to eliminate the officer after a quick duel.</p>

          <h3>The Lion King's Castle</h3>
          <p>The Demon then continued his training and soon decided that, having grown much stronger, it was a good
            chance
            for him to
            confront Von Leon and get the answers that he wanted, as Alcaster had told him that only Von Leon knew the
            details of
            the final battle at the Temple of Time. He decided to use the secret passage from his days as a Commander,
            but
            after
            arriving at the Lion King's Castle, he noted that it was in terrible shape and wondered if Von Leon had
            blocked off the
            secret entrance. However, he was able to find the entrance and used it to enter the Audience Room. Von Leon
            recognized
            the Demon and asked what he wanted, calling the Demon ‘the betrayer'.

            The Demon scoffed his words, claiming that the Black Mage was the true betrayer for having killed his
            family.
            Von Leon
            told him that if that were true, then it was likely part of the Black Mage's grand plan, and that the Demon
            was too
            blinded by anger to see. The Demon replied that he was surprised that someone who had offered their soul to
            the Black
            Mage after losing their own family would say that, adding that the difference between them was that the
            Black
            Mage had
            already betrayed the Demon, whereas the betrayal was yet to come for Von Leon.

            His words angered Von Leon, who loudly asked what there was left for him to lose, as he had lost everything
            that he
            cared about. Seething with rage, he told the Demon that he had nothing more to say to him, as he had no
            interest in the
            disloyal. The Demon assured him that he would leave, but he first asked what had happened to the other
            Commanders. Von
            Leon merely told him to go to the Temple of Time in order to answer his own question there. He then ordered
            the Demon to
            leave and warned that if they met again, he wouldn't hesitate to strike him down. After the Demon left, Von
            Leon blocked
            the secret passageway.</p>

          <h3>Investigating the Temple of Time</h3>
          <p>With most of his power regained, the Demon decided to follow the lead that he had obtained from Von Leon
            and
            investigate
            the Temple of Time. He was hopeful for some meaningful answers, as the Temple of Time had once been the
            Black
            Mage's
            stronghold and the place where he had once been sealed away. Before he headed out, Mastema asked him to
            obtain
            an
            Hourglass of Time during his mission, which had the power to transform one's appearance into what they
            looked
            like in
            the past.

            The Demon arrived at the Temple of Time and entered through the Gate of the Past. He continued onward until
            he
            encountered a hooded demon, who told him that he had been waiting, adding that he was honored that the Demon
            had come
            all the way just for him. The Demon asked the Commander who he was, to which he told the Demon that he would
            find out
            someday. He added that for now, he had something to give him.

            He then passed on a locket, which the Demon recognized as his own locket that held a photo of his mother and
            Damien. The
            Commander explained that he had felt as though he ought to give it back and told him to be careful not to
            lose
            the
            locket or the memories. The Demon asked the Commander why he had the locket to begin with, but the Commander
            chose to
            ignore the question and instead promised him that they would see each other again before disappearing.

            Frustrated, the Demon decided to return to Edelstein, though he made sure to first obtain an Hourglass of
            Time
            for
            Mastema. Back at the Secret Plaza, he gave the hourglass to Mastema, who used it to successfully revert her
            appearance
            back to her demon form. Mastema then took the chance to confess her true feelings to the Demon, but just as
            she said the
            words “I love-“, the magic of the hourglass wore off and she returned back to her cat form.

            The Demon then asked her to continue, but Mastema lost her nerve and instead told him that she had meant to
            say that she
            loved fighting on the side of good. The Demon agreed and told her that fighting the Black Mage had given him
            a
            new
            appreciation for Maple World, adding that he believed that they were doing the right thing.</p>

          <h3>Temple of Time</h3>
          <p>While exploring the Temple of Time, the Demon's memories were drained by Dodo. After being told by the
            Record
            Keeper to
            return to where their adventure began, the Demon wondered which memories the Memory Keeper had been
            referring
            to, and
            whether it was when he had served the Black Mage, when he had battled with his former master, or when he had
            awoken from
            his egg in the Verne Mine.

            He wonders whether he even had any happy memories before recalling memories of his mother and Damien. He
            also
            noted to
            himself that he had enjoyed sparring with Mastema and realized that things didn't all need to be gloom and
            fury. After
            recalling his past memories, the Demon also gained a healthier outlook on life.</p>

          <h3>Final Quest</h3>
          <p>The Demon soon returned to full power and vowed to destroy the Black Mage, believing that it was his
            responsibility to
            ensure that no one would ever experience the pain that he had. As he felt his desire to protect and atone
            for
            his sins,
            new power flooded into him.</p>

          <h3>Fifth Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>Upon entering the Erda Flow and meeting with the Goddess of Maple World, the Goddess asks the player what
            it
            is that
            they cherish most in the world. The Demon get to choose between his old family home, the place where made
            his
            only happy
            memories of Maple World, or Mastema. Mastema gets very flustered if the player chooses her.

            Upon entering the Erda Flow and meeting with the Goddess of Tynerum, the Goddess tells the player that if
            Maple World is
            a world of rules and order, then Tynerum is a world of chaos and uncertainty. She explains that the demons
            have played
            as shadows do in candlelight for a very long time. The Demon gets exclusive dialogue, in which the Goddess
            notes that he
            should know what she's talking about well, since he's a demon himself.</p>
