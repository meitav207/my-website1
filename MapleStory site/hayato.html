            <h1>Hayato</h1>
            <p><b>Hayato</b> Samurai Anegasaki Kenji , or Hayato the Bladed Falcon , is a playable character originating
              from
              Mark of Honor. Armed with a Katana and a Kodachi, Hayato uses quick, flashy combos to slice through his
              enemies.

              Hayato joined forces with the Sengoku Warriors in order to prevent Oda Nobunaga from becoming the Demon
              King.
              After the
              ritual was disrupted, the Sengoku Warriors were unexpectedly transported to Maple World. Under the
              leadership
              of
              Princess Sakuno, Hayato now helps the Sengoku Warriors defeat Oda Nobunaga and return back to their
              homeland.

          <h2>Main Story</h2>
          <h3>Battle at Honnou-ji</h3>
          <p>In the Sengoku era of the world of Sokoku, the Great Diviner, Abeno Seimei, had a premonition that a being
            would appear
            in the nation of Hinomaru with the power of the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, threatening the entire
            realm.
            However,
            Abeno Seimei also had a premonition that five skilled heroes would rise to oppose Oda. These heroes were the
            Children of
            the Five Stars, each bearing a mark somewhere on their bodies that showed proof of their heavenly vessels.

            Centuries later, a warlord named Oda Nobunaga appeared and planned to become the Demon King of the Sixth
            Heaven. With an
            overwhelming military force, Hinomaru was quickly seized into hegemony. For the Demon King Ritual, Oda
            required a
            special sacrifice. Princess Sakuno was the first daughter of the Matsuyama clan and held an immense font of
            mana within
            her body. On Oda's orders, Sakuno was kidnapped and the Matsuyama clan was wiped out. Oda then brought
            Sakuno
            and his
            army to Honnou-ji, where he planned to perform the ritual that would grant him immortality and untold power.

            Hoping to stop him, a united military force of Daimyos, composed of the great lords Mouri Motonari, Uesugi
            Kenshin, and
            Takeda Shingen, formed an alliance called the Sengoku Warriors and led their armies to Honnou-ji Temple in
            order to put
            an end to Oda's ambitions. Hayato was the son of the great samurai Anegasaki Tomonobu, serving as retainer
            to
            the
            Matsuyama clan. Fiercely loyal to Princess Sakuno, Hayato felt great shame for his inability to stop the
            massacre of the
            family whom he served. In order to atone for his failure, Hayato pledged his loyalty to Takeda Shingen.

            Outside the temple walls, Takeda Shingen was rallying his soldiers as they prepared to face Oda's army.
            Hayato
            told
            Shingen that his hands were shaking with anticipation, claiming that the disgrace of the Matsuyama clan
            would
            haunt him
            no more. Shingen told Hayato to keep his emotions in check, though Hayato claimed that the only emotion that
            he and his
            weapon, the Mist Cutter, felt was a thirst for vengeance.

            Shingen laughed at Hayato's seriousness and ordered him to begin the attack by attacking the Eastern Door so
            that the
            cavalry could be let in. Hayato joked that there would be no enemies left for the horses to trample by the
            time that he
            was finished and proceeded to scale up the wall.

            After defeating the Oda soldiers, Hayato opened the gate to let Shingen and his men inside. Hayato reported
            that the
            Uesugi troops had likely barged in too early, and that they would need assistance. Takeda commented that it
            was typical
            of Kenshin to be unable to control her men, though it was unusual for her to be early. Regardless, he
            refused
            to break
            their momentum and ordered his soldiers to charge into the temple.

            As Hayato continued into the temple, he encountered Akechi Mitsuhide, whom he mistook as a woman because of
            his feminine
            appearance and dress. Hayato declared that he was the eldest son of Anegasaki Tomonobu, retainer to the
            Matsuyama clan,
            and that he had come to avenge his family and rescue Princess Sakuno. Akechi laughed at Hayato mistaking him
            for a woman
            and claimed that he vaguely recalled an unimportant family with the name Matsuyama.

            Hayato raised his blade, but before he could attack, Shingen arrived and told him to put his blade away,
            claiming that
            there was no need to waste his time on such a trivial matter. Shingen recognized Akechi as one of Oda's Four
            Heavenly
            Kings, causing Hayato to realize that Akechi was the man who had wiped out the Matsuyama clan and kidnapped
            Princess
            Sakuno.

            Realizing that Akechi was the one who had started the rebellion against Oda, Shingen offered an alliance
            with
            Akechi,
            though an enraged Hayato refused to ally himself with the man who had destroyed his family and instead
            prepared to
            attack. However, Shingen reminded Hayato that rescuing the princess was his priority and told him to hurry
            into the
            temple while he himself handled Akechi. As Hayato rushed off, Akechi vowed to deal with Shingen before
            finding
            Oda,
            raising his blade to attack.

            At the entrance of the temple, Hayato ran into Princess No and asked her to step aside, claiming that he had
            no quarrel
            with her. However, No chastised Hayato for speaking so familiarly with her and introduced herself as Kichou,
            daughter of
            Saitou Dousan and the lawful wife of the Demon King. As No raised her gun to attack, a perfect shot from
            Ayame, hidden
            from a distance, disarmed her. As No was taken aback at the impossible shot, she immediately realized the
            identity of
            the mysterious shooter. Hayato also recognized that the shot had to have come from Ayame and thought to
            himself that he
            owed her his life.

            Hayato entered the temple, ignoring No's cries for him to stop. He then confronted Oda and began to fight
            him,
            while
            Kanna attempted to stop the ritual. Oda managed to easily defeat Hayato and shattered his Mist Cutter, just
            as
            Kanna
            destroyed the ritual altar, causing Princess Sakuno to awaken. Oda then noticed Sakuno attempting to disrupt
            the ritual
            and warned her of the consequences of doing so when the link to the Demon Skies was nearly complete.
            However,
            Sakuno
            merely told Oda that she was unconcerned with the ramifications and disrupted the ritual, creating a large
            beam of light
            that engulfed the temple and transported everyone to Maple World.</p>

          <h3>An Unfamiliar World</h3>
          <p>In Maple World, Hayato awoke in Zipangu and immediately wondered where Princess Sakuno was. He then saw
            that
            the Mist
            Cutter had been shattered and lamented that Oda had destroyed everything that he had. However, he quickly
            picked himself
            back up and began recalling everything that had happened. Realizing that he was in an unfamiliar place, he
            began
            exploring the area and soon encountered a man named Yamanaka Yukimori, who introduced himself as a retainer
            to
            the Amago
            clan.

            Hayato introduced himself by his name, Anegasaki Kenji, causing Yukimori to immediately recognize him as the
            master of
            Battoujutsu. He then began to explain that the strange light had transported them to a new world and led
            Hayato to their
            base, Momijigaoka. Realizing that Hayato had no weapon, Yukimori gave him one before taking his leave.

            Proceeding into the camp, Hayato encountered Mouri Motonari and introduced himself. Motonari greeted him and
            explained
            that he and his sons, who had been the first to arrive, had set up a base of operations and asked to work
            together to
            adjust to the new world. When Hayato asked Motonari what he meant by adjusting, Motonari asked him to move
            as
            he
            normally would. Hayato quickly found that he had a hard time controlling his muscles and wondered whether it
            was because
            of his injuries. Motonari explained that the rules of the new world were different from their homeland, as
            the
            shift in
            spiritual energy had weakened even the strongest amongst them.

            After training to recover some of his strength, Hayato was deemed fit to carry out missions by Motonari.
            Nevertheless,
            Hayato still felt that his strength had diminished greatly and resolved to grow stronger so that he could be
            of use to
            the Sengoku Warriors. He hoped to find Oda Nobunaga as soon as possible in order to rescue Princess Sakuno
            from his
            torment, as well as to prevent his evil from spreading to the people of the new land.

            Just then, Motonari told Hayato that soldiers in dark armor had appeared in the area, and though they likely
            had not yet
            discovered the base, Motonari asked Hayato to dispatch them before they stumbled across it by blind luck.
            Hayato
            defeated the Oda scouts and collected a familiar four-diamond crest. Though he was fairly certain that the
            scouts'
            erratic movement meant that Momijigaoka was safe, he was troubled by the crest, whose pattern was that of
            Takeda
            Shingen, as it meant that his men were in danger.

            As Hayato began searching for Shingen, he ran into Sanada Yukimura, who was relieved to see Hayato. Hayato
            noted that
            Yukimura was exhausted, to which Yukimura explained that he had awoken dazed and weakened after the bright
            light. He
            told Hayato that the Oda scouts had attempted to take him down, though he had managed to fight them off. He
            also told
            Hayato that he had been separated from Shingen during the battle with the scouts. As he was too weak,
            Yukimura
            asked
            Hayato to rescue Shingen in his stead. Hayato agreed and prepared to head out. Before he left, he told
            Yukimura about
            Momijigaoka and asked him to get to safety.

            Hayato proceeded deeper down Maple Hill Road and soon ran into Shingen, who was glad to see him. As Shingen
            was
            exhausted from the battle, Hayato cleared a path through the Oda scouts in order to escort him to the base.
            At
            Momijigaoka, Yukimura was relieved to see Shingen safe, although Uesugi Kenshin wasted no time in throwing
            insults at
            Shingen.

            Motonari quickly broke up the quarrel and began explaining the details of the battle in the temple, as well
            as
            details
            about the new world. He then ordered them to put their rivalry aside, as they needed to focus on building
            their alliance
            to defeat Oda once and for all. Motonari then told Hayato that Oda's army had discovered the base, and that
            their
            numbers would soon overwhelm them. Hayato agreed to lead the assault and proceeded to fight through the
            soldiers,
            discovering a mysterious foxtail along the way.

            Believing that it belonged to Tsuchimikado Haruaki's fox, Hayato brought it back to Motonari, who explained
            that
            warriors who had participated in the raids against Oda's forces had returned with similar tails. Suddenly,
            Haruaki
            emerged from the foxtail, much to everyone's surprise. Haruaki explained that he had arrived before everyone
            else, being
            transported at the same time as Oda and his forces. In order to avoid being discovered by Oda's men, Haruaki
            had
            disguised himself as a number of foxtails, though his soldiers had taken a liking to the foxtails and
            brought
            them, and
            thereby him, straight into their camp.

            Having been rescued by Hayato, Haruaki began explaining the true purpose of the ritual. He explained that
            Oda
            had sought
            to conjure the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven from the Demon Realm, a world much different from their
            homeland
            as Maple
            World was. He explained that much like how it was possible to contact Maple World, Oda had sought to make
            contact with
            the Demon Realm through an ancient ritual.

            Upon discovering the Demon Realm, Oda had devised a plan to create a portal to the Demon Realm in order to
            bring the
            Demon King of the Sixth Heaven into their world, which was why Haruaki had launched the mission at the
            Honnou-ji Temple.
            Though he congratulated them on interrupting the ritual, he explained that no one could have predicted the
            consequences,
            which were that the gate to the Demon Realm had been warped, causing them to be transported to Maple World
            instead.
            Kenshin and Shingen both immediately resolved to defeat Oda, though Motonari reminded them that they needed
            to
            first
            regain their strength.</p>

          <h3>Finding Allies</h3>
          <p>Haruaki then took Hayato aside and confided in him that Princess Sakuno was not among them. Hayato was
            worried that
            Oda's men may have captured her, but Haruaki reassured him that Oda needed her alive, as the ritual required
            the blood
            of her lineage. He also reminded Hayato that he needed to be ready, as the fates of both Sakuno and Oda
            rested
            on his
            shoulders. Noting that Oda already had great knowledge of Maple World, Haruaki decided to send Hayato on a
            mission to
            make alliances and regain his strength. He instructed Hayato to find a nearby town to the south of the camp,
            though he
            warned that the enemy had likely created a pathway to get to it.

            Hayato then fought his way past the Oda forces and soon arrived at the Mushroom Shrine, where he encountered
            Kino
            Konoko. After exchanging greetings, Hayato asked Kino whether she had noticed anything strange in the area.
            Kino told
            him that a group of suspicious people had recently been spotted near the Mushroom Shrine. Hayato decided to
            investigate
            and encountered several Mecha Warrior Prototypes. After defeating them, he reported back to Kino and told
            her
            that they
            were likely not an immediate threat to the Mushroom Shrine. Kino then asked whether Hayato could investigate
            the
            mechanical ninjas in the area, whom Hayato determined to be hostile, numerous, and appearing to be searching
            for
            something.

            Realizing that the robots were a threat to the Mushroom Shrine, Kino asked Hayato to investigate several
            robots wielding
            guns. After defeating them, Hayato warned Kino that the gun-wielding robots were even closer to the Mushroom
            Shrine than
            the mechanical ninjas, and so he warned Kino to be cautious. Kino resolved to seek out long-term help and
            agreed to
            answer Hayato's earlier question about strange occurrences in the area. She explained that there was a
            constant influx
            of dirt blowing into the area, as well as a storm near the shrine, which she noted was an uncommon
            occurrence.

            Hayato realized that Oda must not have made contact yet and asked Kino to point him to the nearest shogun to
            whom he
            could offer his services. Unsure of Hayato's strange question, Kino explained that the closest person to a
            shogun in
            Maple World was either Empress Cygnus in Ereve or Athena Pierce in Henesys. When Hayato was confused about
            how
            to get to
            Henesys, Kino jokingly asked whether Hayato wasn't from Maple World before giving him a book to help get
            acquainted with
            his new surroundings.

            Regarding Maple World itself, Hayato read that a suspicious aura had been reported near the Mushroom Shrine,
            exuding a
            sense of immense power surrounded by darkness and greed. Hayato wondered whether it could have anything to
            do
            with Oda
            Nobunaga. He also read about the Transcendents who maintained balance over the fundamental laws of light,
            life, and
            time. Hayato speculated that there might be other Transcendents that were yet to be discovered and wondered
            whether they
            could help the Sengoku Warriors return home.

            On the next page, he learned about Grandis and its three major races, the Flora, the Nova, and the Anima, as
            well as its
            three Transcendents and their statuses. Finally, he read about the Interdimensional Portal that connected
            Maple World
            and Grandis, lamenting at the possibility that there truly might not be a gateway that could return them
            home.
            Hayato
            then thanked Kino and resolved to visit Athena Pierce. Believing that Hayato had greater need of it, Kino
            allowed Hayato
            to keep the book about Maple World.</p>

          <h3>Rescuing Sakuno</h3>
          <p>Before he could head out, however, Hayato received a letter from Haruaki ordering him to return to
            Momijigaoka
            immediately, as they had discovered the location of Princess Sakuno. Hayato immediately rushed back to base,
            where
            Haruaki told him that their scouts had sighted the princess imprisoned deep within the eastern wing of
            Honnou-ji. Though
            she fortunately appeared healthy, she was under tight watch by the Oda guards.

            Hayato immediately declared that they needed to launch a rescue operation, but Haruaki told him that they
            didn't have
            the strength, reminding Hayato that both he and the rest of their military forces needed more time to
            recover.
            Though he
            conceded that they had made several allies in Maple World, Haruaki explained that they couldn't draw them in
            so soon and
            risk fighting Oda with exhausted forces. Shingen then interjected that he agreed with Haruaki, adding that
            they couldn't
            risk their forces for a single person, even if it was Sakuno herself. However, he claimed that there was
            still
            a way and
            proposed sending a small group of elite warriors to infiltrate the enemy camp.

            With the other Daimyos in agreement, Shingen planned for the group to enter through the western Honnou-ji
            walls, but
            Motonari then suggested that they attack from the east, as Oda wouldn't expect them to strike at the same
            place that
            they had during the original Honnou-ji raid. Hayato begged to be sent, claiming that he needed to regain his
            honor after
            failing to rescue the princess the first time. Shingen agreed and ordered Yukimura to accompany Hayato.

            With the plan finalized, Yukimura moved in first to scout while Hayato followed. After he arrived, he
            rendezvoused with
            Yukimura, who told him that the security around the eastern wing was lacking, just as Shingen and Motonari
            had
            anticipated. He then left Hayato to rescue the princess while he secured their escape route, though he
            warned
            Hayato to
            be cautious, as it was possible that the enemy's frail security might be a trap. Hayato infiltrated Sakuno's
            prison and
            rescued the princess, but just as they were about to escape, an Oda guardsman discovered them and began to
            attack.

            After defeating him, Hayato led Sakuno through the escape route, where Yukimura met them and escorted them
            back safely
            to Momijigaoka. Back at the base, Sakuno met with the leaders of the Sengoku alliance and thanked them for
            the
            rescue
            operation. Having met them for the first time, Sakuno introduced herself as Matsuyama Sakuno, the eldest
            daughter of
            Matsuyama Nobukane and the acting head of the clans. The other Daimyos noted that Sakuno had a commanding
            presence in
            spite of her young age and remained hopeful that she would have the ability to lead the Sengoku alliance.

            Haruaki then asked Sakuno whether she had learned anything about Oda while she had been in his custody, as
            their own
            intel was severely lacking. Sakuno explained that even though the only person she had spoken to was the
            guardsman who
            delivered her meals, she had seen that Oda had been surrounded by many Spirit Walkers and conjurers,
            although
            nothing
            had seemed out of the ordinary. Haruaki then asked Hayato whether he had anything he wanted to add.

            The princess was pleased to see Hayato again and asked how he was. Hayato replied that the journey had been
            difficult,
            but he had borne it for her sake, as he didn't want their fifteen years of friendship to end in tragedy. He
            then
            explained that his family, though small, had served the Matsuyama clan for generations, with his father and
            brothers
            working in her government while he himself had left to study the ways of Battoujutsu.

            Upon returning, he had found himself stunned by her beauty and purity and confessed that she was the reason
            that he
            fought. He added that after Akechi Mitsuhide had destroyed their families, the only hope he had left was
            that
            she still
            lived, and so he had pledged his service to Takeda Shingen in the hopes of finding her again. With her safe
            return,
            Hayato expressed confidence that he would defeat Oda and restore her to the throne.</p>

          <h3>Traces of Akechi Mitsuhide</h3>
          <p>After speaking with Sakuno, Hayato noted that even though the battle was not yet over, he felt a sense of
            peace as he
            realized that Maple World was not so different from his homeland and hoped that he would master his old
            skills
            once
            again. Deciding that he needed to learn more about Maple World before making his next move, Hayato decided
            to
            meet with
            Athena Pierce in Henesys.

            At the Bowman Instructional School, Hayato greeted Athena and explained the situation which had led to him
            being
            transported to Maple World. Though Athena sympathized, she told Hayato that she had no idea about how to
            help
            and
            instead referred him to Grendel the Really Old, to whom she sent a note outlining her request for him to
            help
            Hayato.

            Hayato then traveled to the Magic Library in Ellinia, where Grendel greeted him and recognized him from
            Athena's note,
            which indicated that Hayato was facing the threat of a demon. He asked what sort of demon Hayato was facing,
            citing
            Balrog, the Black Mage, and Pazuzu as many possibilities of the Demon King whom he was hoping to defeat. He
            then gave
            Hayato a list of books to read through, although he discovered that none of them had the answers he sought.
            Grendel
            apologized for not being able to help, though he hoped that Hayato would find his answers when the time was
            right.

            Just then, Hayato received a letter from Athena Pierce, which said that a suspicious man who seemed like he
            had come
            from Hayato's world was speaking with the Black Wings at the Golem Temple. Athena also wrote that he had a
            feminine
            appearance and a large sword. Hayato immediately recognized the man as Akechi Mitsuhide and rushed to the
            Golem Temple.

            He then infiltrated Francis' hideout, where he fought and defeated the Puppeteer. He then asked Francis to
            tell him
            everything he knew of the strange man who had arrived earlier. Francis told him that the man had asked to
            join
            the Black
            Wings, though he had explained that he wasn't the one who made the decision to accept new members, and so he
            had passed
            the man's request on to the leader of the Black Wings. When Hayato asked him what the man's name was,
            Francis
            struggled
            to pronounce it and butchered it as “Akechyou Mister Heydey”.

            Realizing that Francis had meant to say that the man's name was Akechi Mitsuhide, Hayato decided to leave.
            He
            was
            surprised that Akechi wanted to ally with the Black Wings and realized that Oda's ambitions had grown to the
            point that
            he sought to control both Hinomaru and Maple World. He decided to return to the Bowman Instructional School
            and reported
            what he had learned to Athena, warning her that Oda sought to conquer Maple World.

            Athena replied that even though she didn't know much about Hayato's enemies, anyone who allied with the
            Black
            Wings was
            a threat to Maple World, and so she couldn't sit by and watch idly. She then pledged her support to Hayato
            as
            a citizen
            of Maple World and promised to spread the news and gather support from the people to come to her aid.</p>

          <h3>Gift from Takeda Shingen</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Hayato was passing through Momijigaoka and ran into Shingen, who noted that he was looking much
            stronger. He
            explained that he had prepared a gift for him, a great horse, though Hayato would need to get fitted for a
            harness.
            Hayato obtained a harness from Kikkawa Motoharu and brought it to Shingen, who presented Hayato with the
            Great
            Horse
            Onikageh.</p>

          <h3>Meeting with the Empress</h3>
          <p>As Hayato continued to grow stronger, he decided to seek out Empress Cygnus in Ereve. After arriving on the
            island, he
            spoke with Neinheart, who noted that he had never seen someone with as peculiar clothing as Hayato was
            wearing, which
            reminded him of a report he had recently received from Zipangu from an informant that reported that a
            terrible
            storm had
            recently occurred there, with its aftermath bringing forth a new land.

            Realizing that Hayato was from that new land, Neinheart asked whether he was a friend or foe. Hayato
            reassured
            Neinheart
            that he was an ally and explained the story of how his land had been transported to Maple World, as well as
            the threat
            of Oda's army. Neinheart told Hayato that he believed him, as his story lined up with the reports of the
            shift
            in the
            Black Wings' operations.

            He then allowed Hayato to meet Cygnus, who told him that Oda's threat meant that the people of Maple World
            would need to
            rally together to defeat him. She also explained that she would need the full cooperation of the Sengoku
            Warriors and
            asked Hayato to deliver the message. Before Hayato could return to Momijigaoka, Neinheart reported that
            remnants of
            Oda's army had been sighted near El Nath and asked him to meet with Alcaster, who would provide further
            details.</p>

          <h3>Investigating the Black Wings</h3>
          <p>Hayato arrived in Orbis on his way to El Nath, where he encountered Yukimori, who explained that he was
            glad
            to be away
            from the base, as there were many unpleasant people there. Hayato laughed and asked whether he had found
            himself rivals
            in Maple World, though Yukimori clarified that the grudge had come from their homeland. He explained that he
            had served
            the Amago clan until the death of his master, and that he had traveled as a ronin ever since.

            He then revealed that just as Hayato's clan had been broken by Oda Nobunaga, his own had been broken by
            Mouri
            Motonari,
            and that seeing Motonari lauded in the base made his blood boil. However, he reassured Hayato that he would
            continue
            serving the alliance with all his might until the day that he could return to their homeland and seek out
            the
            successor
            to the Amago clan.

            Yukimori then asked Hayato why he had come to Orbis, explaining that he himself was planning to head to
            Orbis
            Station in
            order to board a ship to Ludibrium at Haruaki's request. Hayato told Yukimori that he was on his way to El
            Nath in order
            to meet Alcaster and investigate the sightings of Oda's forces. Yukimori pointed him to Orbis Tower and
            explained that
            he could reach Alcaster by climbing to the bottom of the tower.

            Hayato then traveled to El Nath, where Alcaster informed him that Oda's forces were preparing for a ritual,
            and that one
            of them had the same outfit as Hayato's, only black. Fearing that he was Akechi Mitsuhide, Hayato proceeded
            on
            and soon
            encountered several Oda Spirit Walkers with a Black Wings henchman. He noted that Akechi wasn't present
            amongst them,
            and that they had enchanted several of the monsters nearby. The Black Wings henchman asked the Spirit
            Walkers
            who Hayato
            was, to which they claimed that he was an enemy and moved to attack him.

            After Hayato defeated them, he returned to Alcaster and reported that Oda had used spells to provoke the
            monsters from
            afar, as he was likely aware that Hayato was tracking him. He also reported that he had encountered a
            rabbit-like
            creature and asked what it could be. Alcaster explained that it was a member of the Black Wings, adding that
            things
            would be a lot harder if Oda had sided with them.

            Hayato noted that Cygnus was right about Oda finding allies in Maple World and wondered whether his forces
            were weaker
            than anticipated if he needed the Black Wings' power. He also recalled that it was unlike the Oda clan to
            dilute their
            own power with underhanded deals, with even the use of dark magic to cause chaos in Maple World being
            completely unlike
            the rigid, structured warlord that he knew Oda to be.

            On his way back to report to Momijigaoka, Hayato ran into Yukimori and explained what had happened in El
            Nath.
            Yukimori
            explained that he had found similar evidence in Ludibrium and noted that Oda's alliance with the Black Wings
            did not
            bode well. He offered to bring Hayato's report to the base along with his, allowing Hayato to continue his
            investigations.</p>

          <h3>Joining the Alliance</h3>
          <p>Hayato then continued growing stronger until he was contacted by Shingen, who asked him whether he had ever
            heard of
            Empress Cygnus. When Hayato explained that she was the ruler of Maple World, Shingen told him that Cygnus
            had
            sent an
            invitation for a meeting. He then asked Hayato to go to Ereve as an envoy of the Sengoku alliance.

            Hayato traveled to Ereve, where Cygnus explained that the Black Mage, who had once threatened Maple World,
            had
            returned
            again. Believing that the Black Mage would soon turn to attack other worlds, including Hayato's homeland,
            Cygnus
            extended an invitation to join the Maple Alliance. Hayato agreed with Cygnus' assessment and asked her to
            reach out
            whenever she needed them, promising that the Sengoku Warriors would stand with her.</p>

          <h3>Darkness in Mu Lung</h3>
          <p>As Hayato continued regaining his strength, Princess Sakuno passed along a message from Athena Pierce, who
            had written
            that Oda's troops had been sighted in Mu Lung and requested him to speak with Tae Sang. Hayato traveled to
            Mu
            Lung and
            spoke with Tae Sang, who explained that a group of suspicious people had passed through near the Peach Farm,
            and that
            they wore similar clothing to Hayato.

            Hayato then headed to the Peach Farm and spoke with Tae Soo, who explained that the Peach Monkeys and
            Reindeer
            had gone
            berserk after the suspicious group had passed through. Fearing that they would ruin the harvest, Tae Soon
            asked Hayato
            to calm the monsters down. After Hayato defeated the monsters, he returned to Tae Soon, who wondered why the
            group
            wanted to disrupt the harvest. He then sent Hayato to Do Gong at the Mu Lung Temple, as he kept watch over
            everything
            that happened in Mu Lung.

            Do Gong explained that Maple World's energy flowed strongest in Mu Lung, likening the town as the piece the
            held
            together the whole puzzle. Because of the threat to Mu Lung, Do Gong believed that Maple World's energy was
            the goal of
            the perpetrators. Their actions at the Peach Farm led Do Gong to believe that they would soon be upon the
            forest, where
            the energy of Mu Lung flowed the strongest. He told Hayato to defeat the Sage Cats in the forest, who had
            been
            warped by
            Mu Lung's energy. While fighting the Sage Cats, Hayato found Oda's Clan Seal teeming with dark energy, which
            he brought
            to Do Gong.

            Do Gong realized that Oda's forces had been planning to warp the monsters of Mu Lung and realized that they
            were likely
            heading to the Goblin Forest, which was a sinkhole of energy. Inside the forest, Hayato was shocked to find
            Akechi
            Mitsuhide, who vaguely recognized him. Hayato demanded to know what Akechi was planning by corrupting the
            monsters of
            Maple World.

            Akechi amusedly claimed that he was hoping to spread chaos. He explained that it was a matter of
            misdirection,
            as two
            forces who met on the field of battle did not pay attention to the snake in the grass. Hayato noted that Oda
            must be
            more cowardly than he had first presumed for him to be using such tactics, but Akechi laughed and revealed
            that he had
            left Oda's service long ago, and that he had just been borrowing Oda's name for his goals.

            He then disappeared, but before Hayato could chase after him, King Sage Cat appeared and decided to punish
            Hayato for
            trespassing into his territory. After Hayato defeated him and escaped, he was troubled to know that Akechi
            had
            orchestrated the invasion and realized that he could be more of a threat than Oda. Soon after he sent a
            letter
            to
            Momijigaoka, Hayato received one in response from Princess Sakuno, who thanked him for uncovering the truth
            and reminded
            him that they needed to defeat both Akechi and Oda.</p>

          <h3>Stopping Mori Ranmaru</h3>
          <p>Some time later, Princess Sakuno contacted Hayato and explained that Mori Ranmaru had been discovered.
            Hayato
            vaguely
            recognized the name, and so Sakuno explained that he had been one of Haruaki's students before serving Oda
            Nobunaga,
            having performed the ritual to open a link to the Demon Realm. Sakuno told Hayato that Mori hadn't been seen
            near
            Honnou-ji in some time, though Sanada Yukimura had reported that he was preparing for a ritual deep in the
            mines of El
            Nath.

            Hayato traveled to the El Nath mines and spoke with Yukimura, who explained that Mori was preparing for an
            unknown
            ritual. He wondered whether Mori was planning to open the link to the Demon Realm, though he noted that it
            would be
            impossible without Princess Sakuno. Hayato realized that if Mori was the one who had facilitated the
            connection to the
            Demon Realm, it was entirely likely that he was the one who had masterminded the destruction of the
            Matsuyama
            clan.

            Yukimura told Hayato that his theory may be correct, as Akechi Mitsuhide had attacked the Matsuyama clan and
            kidnapped
            Princess Sakuno, though Mori had ordered it in the first place. Hayato then vowed to defeat Mori as soon as
            Akechi had
            been dealt with. However, Yukimura cautioned him not to give in to personal vengeance, as he would surely
            fall
            to ruin.
            Hayato then calmed himself down and apologized. Yukimura noted that Hayato wasn't so far gone and told him
            to
            stop Mori
            out of duty, not vengeance, as the stain on his heart would be lessened. Hayato then confronted Mori and put
            an end to
            his ritual.</p>

          <h3>Temple of Time</h3>
          <p>While exploring the Temple of Time, Hayato's memories were drained by Dodo. After being told by the Record
            Keeper to
            return to where his adventure began, Hayato decided to return to Momojigaoka and spoke with Mouri Monotari,
            who
            explained that he had been watching Hayato fight for Maple World, and that Hayato's dedication was
            impressive.
            He added
            that he hoped that Hayato could call him an ally, and that the two of them had a great future together. He
            then told
            Hayato to continue his quest while he himself would ensure that they go down in history.</p>

          <h3>Taking Honnou-ji</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Sakuno contacted Hayato once again and ordered him to return to Momijigaoka immediately, as
            Shingen had
            summoned the entire Sengoku alliance. Back at the base, Shingen addressed the Sengoku Warriors and explained
            that Oda's
            forces had been broken, having lost Akechi Mitsuhide and several lesser generals. With Niwa Nagahide
            missing,
            only two
            of the four Heavenly Kings remained: Shibata Katsuie and Takigawa Kazumasu.

            He also explained that he had just received word that Oda had moved his base out of Honnou-ji, and though
            Shibata was
            possibly in the area, Shingen expressed his confidence that they could take Honnou-ji for themselves. The
            Daimyos
            resolved to take the temple and sent their forces immediately. At the southern gate, the Daimyos gathered
            together,
            where Shingen told Hayato that because of his accomplishments in Maple World, he was the only one that
            Shingen
            could
            trust to create a diversion for their forces to charge in.

            Hayato entered the battlefield and fought the soldiers, allowing the Sengoku Warriors to follow. He then
            proceeded
            deeper and fought the samurai captains in the temple plaza. Shingen then asked him to defeat Takigawa and
            claim victory
            for their forces. Inside the temple, Hayato encountered Takigawa and urged him surrender, claiming that
            there
            was no
            reason for him to throw his life away for Oda. Reminding Hayato that he was one of the Four Heavenly Kings,
            Takigawa
            charged to attack.

            After a fierce battle, Hayato managed to defeat him. Hayato then demanded to know where Oda was hiding, but
            Takigawa
            laughed that he didn't know, as Oda would not be so foolish as to reveal his plans to mere footsoldiers. He
            explained
            that the only thing he knew was that Honnou-ji was worthless before collapsing. News of the alliance's
            victory
            quickly
            spread amongst the troops as they all celebrated having retaken Honnou-ji.

            In Momijigaoka, Haruaki congratulated the alliance, though he noted that there was more work to be done, as
            Oda was
            missing and his base's location remained a mystery. He lamented that the only thing they had learned was
            that
            Honnou-ji
            once had great spiritual power, though it seemed to be gone. He speculated that if Oda had left Honnou-ji to
            find a new
            base, he would likely be looking for a location of great power.</p>

          <h3>Energy of Mars</h3>
          <p>While helping Princess Sakuno divine her ominous dreams, a traveler met with Hayato at the Hidden Ghost
            Shrine, where he
            gave them a Warrior's Soul Spear, which contained the energy of Mars.</p>

          <h3>Stellar Detectives</h3>
          <p>Hayato and Kanna joined forces with Chase, Jett, and Zen after PULSAR kidnapped, Nene, a mystical turtle
            with
            an immense
            font of mana. The group called themselves the Stellar Detectives and eventually discovered a large research
            ship which
            PULSAR had hijacked, where they were attempting to drain Nene's mana in order to create mutant clone copies
            of
            the
            mystical animal. The Stellar Detectives successfully rescued Nene and stopped PULSAR, although the Space
            Pirate
            Commander wiped their memories. Eventually, Hayato and the others regained their memories and vowed to stop
            PULSAR.</p>

          <h3>Black Heaven</h3>
          <p>Several days after the operation to rescue 10 Boogies, Princess Sakuno addressed the entire Sengoku
            alliance.
            Sakuno
            explained that a few days ago, she had received a letter from Neinheart that Maple World was being
            confronted
            by an
            incredible menace, and that the entire Alliance was moving to combat it. She added that Neinheart had also
            closed his
            letter with a request for help from the Sengoku Warriors. She then told the soldiers that even though Maple
            World wasn't
            their home, they had learned to appreciate it, as it had much of the beauty and tranquility of their
            homeland.

            In the name of the Matsuyama clan, Sakuno then ordered the Sengoku Warriors to claim an honorable victory
            over
            the Black
            Wings. Motonari, Shingen, and Kenshin immediately moved to mobilize their troops as Sakuno took Hayato aside
            and
            explained that Empress Cygnus had bestowed a special mission upon him. She told Hayato that Cygnus valued
            his
            courage
            and skills, and so the Empress wished for Hayato to join her on the front lines.

            Though Hayato was grateful, he began asking whether his place was with Sakuno, though the princess reminded
            him that it
            was a great opportunity for him to bring honor to the Sengoku Warriors. Hayato then swore by the name of
            Battoujutsu
            that he would bring victory. Sakuno approvingly noted that he wouldn't let her down.

            She then admitted that her heart was beating faster ever since the Empress had called upon him and wondered
            whether it
            was jealousy. An embarrassed Hayato began spluttering as Sakuno laughed at his expression, telling him that
            Shingen had
            suggested that it would help relieve his tension. She then told Hayato to travel safety, reminding him that
            he
            was her
            sword.

            After Athena Pierce and the player fight their way to the main deck, Athena gives a word of encouragement to
            the player
            as they charge into battle, which depends on their class. For Hayato, Athena tells him to show the enemies
            his
            power.</p>

          <h3>Vanishing Journey</h3>
          <p>After the player defeats Arma, Kao will speak to the player while being carried through the cave. Kao asks
            Hayato if he
            remembers when he had awakened with the power of the Seal Stone. Kao recalls his own life, and how he had
            shouldered the
            responsibility to save another dimension instead of his own. Though he hadn't shown it, Kao notes that it
            must
            have
            weighted on himself, and for good reason, as it was someone else's world and not his own.

            However, Kao adds that he had taken his responsibilities seriously, and though he wants to say that his
            heart
            had been
            true, he finds that he's not sure anymore. He then wonders whether there's someone better than him who can
            actually save
            the world. Kao then supposes that he had lost his worthiness the moment that his faith had wavered.</p>

          <h3>Labyrinth of Suffering</h3>
          <p>After Cygnus tells Neinheart that she will lead the fleet into Tenebris in the Adversary's place, Hayato
            gets
            exclusive
            dialogue, in which he notes to himself that the Empress is more resolved than ever. Thinking about her
            determination,
            Hayato reminds himself that they need to defend Maple World.

            When the player first meets with Azalin - Hilla disguised as a Night Walker - she will tell Hayato that she
            had always
            been surprised to hear that he had helped Maple World so much, since he's not from around there. She adds
            that
            in any
            event, she knows that there are two sides, and so she asks him which one he's on, laughing that he'll need
            allies who
            can help him out in a pinch. She then asks if she's hit a nerve before adding that she didn't mean it, and
            that she'd
            just been thinking out loud.

            After the Adversary collapses into despair as a result of Hilla's machinations, they pass out in a void of
            darkness
            within their own mind. As their morale and strength threaten to diminish completely, the mysterious divine
            light speaks
            to them in the form of someone close to them and provides them motivation to continue.

            For Hayato, the voice of Princess Sakuno asks him why he risks his life to save others. Hayato tells Sakuno
            that it's
            because everyone is that precious to him, to which Sakuno asks him why he cares so much for Maple World. She
            points out
            that it isn't Zipangu and asks what makes him fight for it. Hayato replies that Maple World is the home
            where
            his loved
            ones live, and that it's a precious place, filled with all their memories.

            He adds that it's also where his lord lives, and that for her, he'll do whatever he must to protect it.
            Sakuno
            asks him
            if he can remember what she needs to do now, to which Hayato begins to say hopelessly that everyone is
            already
            dead, and
            that he couldn't protect anyone. He adds that there's nothing that he can do, and that he's completely
            helpless before
            asking what else he can do, adding that he's failed yet again.

            Sakuno then tells him to see the world with his own eyes, explaining that even if Hilla covers his eyes, she
            can never
            cover the truth. She asks him to open his eyes, pick himself up, and do what he has to do. She calls Hayato
            her sword
            and reminds him that he simply needs to eliminate everything that gets in their way. She reminds him that
            all
            roads
            exist inside his heart, and to never forget that. She then tells him to be sure to return, adding that she's
            waiting for
            him. As the voice fades away, Hayato recognizes the voice as belonging to Princess Sakuno.</p>

          <h3>Limina</h3>
          <p>When the Adversary faces the Black Mage, he tells them that their path has always been preordained. In
            response to his
            words, Hayato vows that he'll transcend the destiny that the Black Mage has created for the sake of everyone
            who calls
            Maple World home.

            In the final act of Limina, the Adversary (your character) dies after defeating the Black Mage. The
            Adversary
            wakes up
            in the Erda Flow, serving as the afterlife, where the White Mage thanks you for putting an end to the
            battle.
            After the
            conversation, he gives you a unique title based on your class; the title he gives to Hayato is "Honorable
            Warrior".

            After the battle of Tenebris, the Adversary will meet with Neinheart and several members of the Alliance,
            which is
            dependent on the player's class. For Hayato, Neinheart tells him that all of Maple World owes him a debt
            that
            can never
            be repaid. Cygnus adds that peace has been brought back to Maple World because of people from other worlds
            like him, for
            which he has her utmost gratitude. Princess Sakuno then arrives, much to Hayato's surprise, and replies that
            they stand
            together as one Alliance.

            She explains that Maple World has accepted them, and so it's only right for them to return the favor. She
            then
            turns to
            Hayato and notes that he's saved the world yet again, adding that she couldn't be prouder. Cygnus thanks
            Sakuno and
            promises that the Alliance will be there when the Sengoku Warriors need help, just as Hayato and the Sengoku
            Warriors
            have done. Sakuno replies that she doesn't need a reward for helping her comrades, though she adds that she
            appreciates
            the sentiment.</p>

          <h3>Aftermath</h3>
          <p>Several days after the victory at Tenebris, Princess Sakuno addressed the Sengoku Warriors at Momijigaoka.
            She told the
            soldiers that when they had first joined forces with the Alliance, their goal had simply been to vanquish
            Oda
            Nobunaga,
            and that they never would have suspected that their battle would have taken them to Maple World, where they
            would meet
            new enemies and allies alike.

            Having fought with the Alliance, she proudly proclaimed that they had vanquished the Black Mage, whom she
            called the
            greatest evil of all. She then congratulated the troops for their dedication before presenting Hayato, whom
            she
            described as having led the battle with courage and honor. As the soldiers cheered Hayato, Shingen noted
            that
            the time
            for celebration was upon them. Yukimura also proudly told Hayato that he had been impressive, adding that
            Hayato had
            also taught him much.

            Kenshin warmly told Hayato that he had become a blade of justice to cut down his foes, though Kanetsugu
            stubbornly
            reminded him that he still wasn't as great as Kenshin. Haruaki then told Hayato that he had exceeded all
            expectations,
            even exceeding Haruaki's wildest dreams. Motonari proudly noted that the Sengoku Warriors were now feared
            and
            renowned
            worldwide, which was an excellent position for them.

            However, Sakuno then reminded the crowd that the path ahead was still difficult, as Oda Nobunaga, Akechi
            Mitsuhide, and
            the villains of Grandis were still enemies that they were yet to face. However, she proclaimed that their
            unbreakable
            bonds of unity would see them prevail the battles ahead. With that, she declared that they would celebrate
            their victory
            in Hayato's honor.

            Later that night, Hayato found Sakuno in her chambers. Sakuno once again thanked Hayato for the crucial role
            he had
            played in their victory. Hayato dismissed her words, claiming that he had only done his duty, though he
            apologized for
            not being able to stay by her side during the battle. However, Sakuno waved away his apology, noting that he
            had far
            more important things to be worrying about at the time.

            She then recalled how they had known each other for a long time, and how, even when they had been young, he
            would throw
            himself into danger without a second thought if he believed that it was right. She then proudly noted that
            in
            their
            adulthood, he had become the savior of Maple World and the hero of the Sengoku Warriors. She explained that
            by
            defeating
            the Black Mage, he hadn't merely protected her, but the entire world.

            She then told Hayato that he had always been her noble sword, and that she knew that he would continue to be
            so. Moved
            by her words, Hayato proclaimed that she was his light, and that the memory of her voice was what had saved
            him when he
            had been swallowed by the darkness. He then declared that his sword would always serve her. Sakuno
            graciously
            thanked
            Hayato and told him that if he was prepared, she had a new quest for him. She then asked Hayato to gaze up
            at
            the moon
            and tell each other stories of home. Though Hayato was flustered by her request, he nevertheless obeyed.</p>
