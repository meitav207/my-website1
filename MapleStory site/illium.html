            <h1>Illium</h1>
            <p><b>Illium</b> is a member of the Verdant Flora race and a descendant of those surviving Verdant Flora. He
              is
              a Magician-type
              class who uses a Lucent Gauntlet as a primary weapon and Lucent Wings as a secondary weapon.
            </p>
            <p>Born as a commoner with no magical abilities, Illium grew up as a young boy with exceptional mastery over
              engineering.
              His hidden talent was recognized by Agate, the Headmistress of the Crystal Academy, and despite having no
              magic, Illium
              became enrolled as a student.

              When the Verdant Flora are betrayed by one of their own, Illium is entrusted with the mysterious Elder
              Crystal, created
              by the savior of their people - the God of the Verdant Flora. After fusing with the crystal, Illium's
              appearance and
              personality merge with that of the God's, awakening immense magical power inside him. Leading the last
              survivors of the
              Verdant Flora, Illium hopes to find a new home for his people and awaken the full power of the Elder
              Crystal
              in the
              Sanctuary of the Ancient God, hidden somewhere in Maple World.</p>

          <h2>Story</h2>
          <h3>Flora Civil War</h3>
          <p>Hundreds of years ago, the most powerful race on Grandis were the Flora - magic users with brilliant red
            wings and
            mastery over the mytocrystals that they used to cast their magic. Through their wings, they channeled the
            flow
            of mana
            into the mytocrystals embedded on the back of their hands, allowing them to cast powerful spells. The Flora
            were a
            caste-based society, with the God-King on top, followed by the Gods, the Priests, and the powerless
            commoners
            on the
            bottom.

            The last God-King of the Flora had once been a kind man, protected by the Knights of the Einherjar. Several
            years into
            his reign, however, he inexplicably underwent a dramatic change of personality. In his belligerence, he
            attempted to
            incite a war against the other races of Grandis.

            A faction of Flora opposed the God-King's mandate and asked that he strive for peace with the other races.
            However, when
            it was revealed that the faction had plans to share their power with the commoners, they were accused of
            treason. They
            had their wings and magic stripped, and they were then exiled. They became known as the Verdant Flora, while
            the ruling
            faction became known as the High Flora.

            In exile, the Verdant Flora struggled to create their own society without their powers. Eventually, the God
            of
            the
            Verdant Flora discovered a way to combine technology with their residual crystal magic, allowing them to
            regain much of
            their old power through mechanical blue wings.

            Their God, who would later be known as the Ancient Master, also created a powerful artifact called the Elder
            Crystal,
            upon which he imprinted his consciousness and his power. Through unknown means, he was also able to create a
            pocket
            dimension in Maple World, which would later be known as the Sanctuary of the Ancient God, through which he
            could speak
            with one who had fused with him through the Elder Crystal.

            Eventually, the Verdant Flora learned of the dark ambitions of Prince Gerand Darmoor to seize control of the
            capital
            with the help of some of the Knights of the Einherjar. The Verdant Flora rushed to the High Flora capital,
            only to find
            that the prince had murdered his father and framed the Verdant Flora, thus sparking the Flora Civil War. The
            bloody
            conflict lasted for hundreds of years, with great casualties on both sides.

            The conflict between the High Flora and Verdant Flora reached its peak in a final battle, causing massive
            death on such
            a scale that it finally broke the balance of life on Grandis, resulting in Darmoor's awakening as the
            Transcendent of
            Life.

            With his new powers, Darmoor obliterated nearly every living being on the battlefield. He then approached
            the
            wounded
            God of the Verdant Flora, who had managed to survive Darmoor's attack, and sealed him inside the mytocrystal
            on the back
            of his hand. He then sacked the Verdant Flora capital of Aboris, effectively ending the war.

            Meanwhile, the surviving Verdant Flora retreated from Aboris. Agate, the disciple of the God of the Verdant
            Flora, took
            the Elder Crystal and led the survivors into a pocket dimension called Sanctuary. There, the Verdant Flora
            lived in
            secrecy for many decades. Agate became the Headmistress of the Crystal Academy, where she would oversee the
            training of
            future generations of Verdant Flora, hoping that one of them would grow up the become the hero that would
            save
            their
            people.</p>

        <div class="main_story">
          <h2>Main Story</h2>
          <h3>The Boy with No Wings</h3>
          <p>Decades later, a Verdant Flora boy named Illium was studying the history of the Flora with the help of his
            robot, Ex.
            Illium needed parts for his machines, but since the Verdant Flora were isolated in Sanctuary, his only hope
            was to use
            the Crystal Gate in order to enter the outside world, though he knew that attempting to leave Sanctuary was
            punishable
            by imprisonment. Illium briefly considered using a flash bomb to sneak past the guards around the Crystal
            Gate, but he
            ultimately decided against it.

            However, Ex interpreted his words as a command and launched a flash bomb on the guards. Though he was
            startled
            by Ex's
            unexpected actions, Illium used it as an opportunity to sneak past the blinded guards and made his way to
            the
            Crystal
            Gate. Just as the guards regained their sight, Illium entered the Crystal Gate and arrived in Savage
            Terminal.
            He was
            shocked to learn that the Verdant Flora were hiding in a scrapyard, but Ex pointed out that it was the ideal
            place for
            them to hide. Illium then began hunting Hedgehogs in order to obtain the parts that he needed.

            Meanwhile, Agate arrived in Savage Terminal and asked two of her fellow Verdant Flora, Darius and Curly,
            whether they
            had seen anything during their patrol. Curly reported that he had overheard a conversation earlier about
            someone having
            sighted a High Flora in Savage Terminal. Agate grew concerned and asked if the rumor was true, but Curly
            believed that
            it was likely a Verdant Flora because their wings had been reported to be mechanical, making the others
            realize that
            someone had illegally left Sanctuary. Agate asked Darius to investigate and to ensure that their safety
            hadn't
            been
            compromised.

            Just then, one of the Crystal Gate guards contacted Agate and reported that a child had just left Sanctuary.
            After a
            brief investigation, they confirmed that the missing child was Illium. Agate told the others that she would
            find Illium
            and ordered them to wait for her in Sanctuary. She soon found Illium and Ex being attacked by a group of
            Hoodlums. Ex
            was worried that Illium's vitals were critically low, but just then, a flash of light emanated from Illium
            that defeated
            all the Hoodlums and knocked out the exhausted boy.

            Agate took Illium and Ex back to Sanctuary, where the boy woke up to Agate and the guards standing over him.
            Agate asked
            Illium how old he was, to which he responded that he was 153. She noted that the mytocrystal on the back of
            his hand was
            faint for his age, and that his wings lacked magical aura, meaning that the power that he had exhibited
            earlier had been
            much greater than he seemed capable of. Agate told him that leaving Sanctuary was forbidden and asked if he
            was prepared
            to accept the consequences.

            When Illium apologized to her, she asked if he even knew who she was. Ex answered for him and explained that
            she was the
            Seeker of the Verdant Flora and the Headmistress of the Crystal Academy, and that accompanying her were
            Darius, the
            Guardian of the Verdant Flora, and Curly, the Engineer of the Verdant Flora. Agate was impressed by Illium's
            engineering
            abilities and told him that because of his young age and his mechanical aptitude, she was willing to let him
            off with a
            warning. However, as punishment, he would begin courses at the Crystal Academy, much to the shock of both
            Illium and the
            guards.

            Later on, Ex told Illium that it was hardly a punishment, as many dreamed of attending the prestigious
            Crystal
            Academy.
            Illium asked what had happened before he had been knocked out, to which Ex explained that Illium had had a
            magical
            overload, and that the resulting explosion had defeated the Hoodlums.</p>

          <h3>The Crystal Academy</h3>
          <p>The next day, Illium and Ex met Agate outside the Crystal Academy. She gave them a tour of the facility and
            told Illium
            that while he didn't seem to possess control over his mytocrystal, he still possessed power, however
            unstable.
            She
            explained that she had brought him to the Academy so that he could learn how to control his powers in a safe
            environment.

            Illium then went to his first class, where he was surprised at how many students there were. Though he was
            afraid of
            social interaction, he decided to engage in class nonetheless. Professor Kalsat then began his lecture about
            the
            different types of mytocrystals. The first crystal he showed was grossular, a green crystal used to treat
            wounds and
            recover health. Next, he showed a red crystal called pyrope, which had explosive power, but was difficult to
            extract
            mana from.

            Throughout the lecture, Illium tried to answer the professor's questions, but he spoke very quietly in order
            to avoid
            attracting attention. When Kalsat asked about a third type of crystal, Ex grew frustrated by Illium's
            reticence and
            loudly answered that it was obsidian, which was difficult to find and held dark magical energy, which one
            should be
            cautious of. Kalsat was impressed by Ex and told the class that for the rest of the lesson, they were to
            collect
            grossular shards from Green Grossular monsters. Having little magical power, Illium took much longer to
            collect the
            shards and became late to return to class.

            For his next lesson, Illium went to magical combat training, led by Professor Andrada. The students took
            turns
            attacking
            a dummy, but when Illium's turn came, he was only able to use a weak physical attack. Andrada instructed him
            to gather
            the mytocrystal energy inside his wings and transfer it to the mytocrystal on the back of his hand in order
            to
            launch a
            magical attack.

            When he realized that Illium had no wings, he encouraged the boy to find other ways to use magic, even if
            they
            were
            unorthodox. Illium then used one of his mechanical javelins to attack the dummy, causing it to explode. The
            other
            students were awestruck by his attack and wondered how he had done it. Andrada was impressed and then
            instructed the
            class to eliminate practice robots in the combat training room. Though Illium was unable to meet his quota
            of
            robots to
            destroy, Andrada accepted his work nevertheless.

            As Illium and Ex moved to their next class, Agate spoke to them telepathically and asked how classes were
            going,
            explaining that she could communicate with him through the lights. Knowing that he was struggling, she told
            him not to
            be discouraged and offered private tutoring lessons after school in order for him to be able to catch up
            with
            the rest
            of his class.

            After Illium's next lesson ended, two students named Dean and Sinaria approached Illium and introduced
            themselves. Dean
            was curious about Ex and why Illium had no wings, as well as why the mytocrystal on his hand didn't glow.
            Illium was
            overwhelmed by Dean's rapid-fire questions, which Sinaria interpreted to mean that Illium didn't want to
            talk
            to them.
            As they left, Illium called out that he really was happy to have met them, adding that he had just been
            nervous. A girl
            named Carnelian then introduced herself and explained that Dean was generally overenthusiastic. With that,
            she
            left for
            her next class and Illium left for his.

            Illium's third class was on Gate Creation and taught by Professor Citrine. She explained that the mana that
            the Verdant
            Flora drew from mytocrystals was used for their spells, and that one application of it was the creation of
            Crystal
            Gates. She explained that Sanctuary existed within a Crystal Gate, and that it served as a virtual space
            created with
            magic, which was why the sky was perpetually dark and filled with crystalline shapes. Though the Crystal
            Gate
            was
            extremely useful in hiding themselves from the High Flora, she explained that construction of a gate was
            quite
            difficult.

            For their first class exercise, Citrine asked them to get into pairs of two. Illium was quite flustered at
            having to
            interact with others, but despite his best efforts, he was unable to find a group. Just then, a boy named
            Morian
            approached Illium and suggested that they team up, since they were the only two without a group. After
            everyone found
            their groups, Citrine told them to collect Amethyst Shards for their gates. Illium and Morian struggled to
            gather enough
            shards and eventually returned late to class, where Citrine told them that she expected further improvement
            in
            the
            future. After class ended, Ex guided Illium to the Headmistress' office so that he could begin his lessons
            with Agate.</p>

          <h3>Lessons with Agate</h3>
          <p>Outside the office, Illium overheard Darius asking Agate what she had been thinking by rewarding Illium for
            behavior
            that could have endangered all the Verdant Flora. He warned her that Illium's actions could have resulted in
            their
            discovery, or worse, the loss of the Elder Crystal, and suggested that they strengthen security around it by
            stationing
            more guards. Agate assured him that the Elder Crystal was safe before greeting Illium, whom she had noticed
            standing
            outside. With that, she asked Darius to take his leave.

            After he left, she asked Illium if he had overheard everything, which he sheepishly confirmed. Ex then
            explained that
            some of the students had behaved unfavorably towards Illium, but Agate reassured Illium that it would get
            better with
            time. She told him that he was special because he was the only one to have overcome his limitations so
            spectacularly,
            and she encouraged him to believe in himself and train hard.

            For their lessons, she had Illium attack larger practice dummies with his javelin. After successfully
            defeating them,
            Agate told him that he would grow more powerful with practice. Illium asked if it would be possible for him
            to
            become as
            strong as her, to which she promised him that with his talents, he had the ability to surpass her. Over the
            next few
            months, Illium continued to practice under Agate's tutelage, fondly considering his lessons with her to be
            the
            best time
            that he ever had at the Crystal Academy. With her help, Illium grew much stronger and honed his unique style
            of fighting
            in the absence of his wings.

            One day, Illium left Agate's office and decided to head to the library for his studies. Just then, he heard
            somebody
            shouting for help. He entered the training room and found Dean being attacked by haywire training robots.
            After Illium
            and Ex rescued him, Dean thanked them and apologized for his behavior in the past. Illium accepted his
            apology
            and even
            helped Dean recover his belongings from the training robots. After Dean left, Ex told Illium that someone
            had
            tampered
            with the training robots and warned him that no one in the Crystal Academy was safe. Illium assured him that
            they would
            tell Agate during their lessons tomorrow.

            The next day, Illium was studying history in Professor Lutil's class. Sinaria summarized their last lesson
            on
            the Flora
            Civil War, in which Prince Gerand Darmoor had nearly wiped out the Verdant Flora and had banished their God.
            In exile,
            their God had helped the Verdant Flora recover their power by creating mechanical wings, which allowed them
            to
            draw mana
            and channel it through the mytocrystals on the back of their hands.

            Professor Lutil told the class that the God of the Verdant Flora was the hero of their race, and that the
            annual
            Festival of the Gods was intended to honor him and bring hope to their people. She reminded them that the
            festival would
            be held at the end of the semester, and that the Crystal Academy would be responsible for organizing a grand
            display of
            lights and magic.</p>

          <h3>Festival of the Gods</h3>
          <p>As the end of the semester approached, the students were tasked with creating sculptures. Ex helped Illium
            construct his
            sculpture by directing him to gather Pyrope Shards. As Illium and Morian finished gathering their shards,
            they
            heard
            someone crying. They discovered Carnelian, who told them that Dean had transformed her crystals into candy.
            Illium and
            Morian gave her some of the crystals that they had gathered, which she was greatly appreciative of. After
            making up the
            difference, Illium and Morian returned to class, where Lutil reminded them to display their sculptures in
            the
            town
            square.

            Next, they went to their Crystal Gate class, where Citrine explained that those who hadn't finished their
            homework would
            need to stay after class. She then told everyone that after the lesson, they would be able to create a small
            Crystal
            Gate to hide in. She instructed them to gather Obsidian Shards, which were held in the classroom, since they
            were
            dangerous. After gathering their mytocrystals, the class succeeded in creating a small Crystal Gate that
            allowed
            everyone to enter. After class was over, Morian was required to stay behind since he hadn't finished his
            homework.

            Agate then contacted Illium and told him that their lesson would take place at the Sanctuary Entrance. At
            the
            entrance,
            Illium and Ex overheard some soldiers saying that there were rumors that Specters had managed to get
            through.
            However,
            their superiors had managed to stop the intruders and had moved the Crystal Gate as a precaution. As Illium
            began to
            look around for Agate, the guards asked him to help them extract mana from nearby mytocrystals. Illium
            harvested
            Sanctuary mytocrystals and brought them back to the guards.

            Just then, Agate appeared and thanked the soldiers for their hard work. Illium asked her if they were in
            danger from the
            Specters, but Agate assured him that nothing would happen as long as they stayed vigilant. After their
            lesson,
            Illium
            began to head back to the school. Just then, Morian arrived and told him that he had just finished his
            private
            tutoring
            lesson with Professor Citrine. He asked Illium if he wanted to get food, but Illium told him that he wanted
            to
            start on
            his sculpture.

            Illium and Ex went to the lab and got started on their sculpture using the Pyrope Shards that they had
            gathered in
            class. Illium was determined to do his statue justice, as the festival felt much more meaningful to him as
            of
            late. He
            told Ex that when he was younger, he would visit the Festival of the Gods every year and look at the
            mysterious lights.
            However, his time with Agate and the others had taught him to appreciate the lights as testaments to their
            efforts.
            After gathering more materials, he continued to work and soon created a mechanical statue.

            Just then, Darius appeared and scoffed at Illium's efforts, calling him a low-level engineer. He ordered
            Illium to throw
            away his project immediately, claiming that it was an affront to the Gods of the Flora. Ex attempted to
            console Illium
            by telling him that the Verdant Flora had regained their magic by combining mytocrystals and technology, and
            so in all
            likelihood, the Gods of the Flora would have been pleased by Illium's unique creation. Illium thanked Ex and
            decided to
            continue enhancing his project with rarer metals.

            After improving his statue further, he sensed a crystal glowing nearby. As he approached it, the light that
            it
            gave off
            in response to Illium's presence significantly increased. Against Ex's recommendations, he touched the Elder
            Crystal,
            causing a strong magical reaction. Just then, Agate appeared and chastised Illium for using Academy crystals
            without
            permission. After she left, Illium wondered why Agate had been unnecessarily harsh. Unbeknownst to him,
            Darius
            had been
            watching in secret.

            Soon after, Illium finished the rest of his sculpture and was pleased by his final product. At the Festival
            of
            the Gods,
            everyone was unanimously impressed with Illium's creation, which combined mytocrystals with technology
            flawlessly. After
            the festival was over, Illium was inspired to enhance his sculpture and transformed it into another robot
            named Machina.</p>

          <h3>Fall of Sanctuary</h3>
          <p>Just then, Illium heard a disturbance and went outside to see what was going on. He was shocked to find
            that
            the
            tampered training robots from the other day were attacking the Crystal Academy. Outside, the Crystal Gate
            had
            opened to
            allow Specters to invade Sanctuary. Curly reassured the soldiers that if they defeated all the Specters,
            they
            wouldn't
            be found out. However, Darius appeared and opened several more Crystal Gates. Curly asked Darius how he
            could
            have
            betrayed his people, to which Darius explained that he would rather destroy everything than see the future
            tainted by
            the abominations created by engineers such as Curly.

            Agate and the other professors rushed to the school entrance, where Darius told Agate that all of it could
            have been
            avoided if she had only handed over the Elder Crystal to him without a fight. The other professors tried to
            tell Agate
            that it was too late to save Sanctuary, but Agate refused to give up hope. She ordered the students to take
            shelter from
            the Specters, just as Illium rushed outside to see the situation. He told Agate that he could help, but
            Agate
            told him
            that he could do more good by protecting his friends.

            The students then rushed into the school and barricaded themselves inside, but Specters still managed to
            enter
            the
            halls. The students then watched in amazement as Illium single-handedly drove back the Specters with the
            help
            of Ex and
            Machina. They all wondered how Specters could have entered the school and briefly wondered whether the
            professors had
            been defeated. However, Illium refused to believe it, claiming that Agate was stronger than that.
            Just then, a wounded Agate arrived and Ex noted that her magic was dangerously out of balance, likely from
            excessive
            energy expenditure. Against Illium's protests that she needed healing, Agate opened a Crystal Gate for the
            students to
            escape through. All the students disappeared through the gate except for Illium, who continued to stay
            behind.
            He asked
            Agate if she was coming with them, but just then, Darius appeared with the Specter army. Illium jumped in
            front of
            Agate, promising to protect her. However, Darius began charging up an attack that Ex noted would be fatal to
            them, and
            so Agate pushed Illium aside and blocked the attack single-handedly. Darius was shocked that Agate still
            possessed such
            power in spite of her exhaustion and immediately retreated.

            Severely drained, Agate collapsed on the floor, and with last bit of strength that she had left, she gave
            Illium the
            Elder Crystal, explaining that it was the relic of her master, the last God of the Verdant Flora, and that
            it
            was the
            last remaining key to unleashing his power. She told Illium that the door to the Sanctuary of the Ancient
            God
            awaited
            him in a different dimension and tasked him with finding it in order to awaken the Elder Crystal's power.
            With
            her dying
            breath, she entrusted the fate of the Verdant Flora in Illium's hands and reminded him that no matter what
            anyone else
            said, he was special.

            Just then, a horde of Specters arrived and surrounded Illium. Ex detected an immensely powerful force
            radiating from the
            crystal and warned Illium that he was detecting a foreign consciousness within the relic. Against Ex's
            recommendation,
            Illium grasped the Elder Crystal in both hands, allowing its power to flow through him. Illium's appearance
            and
            personality then fused with that of the God of the Verdant Flora, turning his dark hair, which normally
            covered his
            eyes, short and snow white, and from his back grew radiant blue wings.

            With his new powers, he easily destroyed the Specters around him and promised his fallen teacher that he
            would
            master
            the powers of the Elder Crystal in order to protect the Verdant Flora and defeat Darmoor. He and Ex then
            rushed outside
            the Academy and found Morian and Sinaria trapped beneath rubble.

            After rescuing them, the trio fought their way past Specters until they met Dean and Carnelian. Illium
            explained what
            had happened with Agate and the Elder Crystal and told them that they needed to survive and carry out
            Agate's
            final
            wish. They gathered the rest of the students and rushed to the main Crystal Gate. Morian noted that there
            was
            something
            off about the gate, but the students nevertheless jumped through it and arrived in Savage Terminal.

            However, the Crystal Gate suddenly collapsed, cutting them off from Sanctuary. The students wondered whether
            they would
            ever be able to reach Sanctuary again, but Dean rallied them together and vowed that they would return to
            Sanctuary
            together as the Verdant Flora Youth Expedition. Illium was pleased that everyone had agreed to follow him
            and
            told them
            that, together, they would find the Sanctuary of the Ancient God.</p>

          <h3>Seeking Asylum</h3>
          <p>As he was the only one who had been outside Sanctuary before, Illium led them around Savage Terminal. Just
            then, a group
            of Roving Hoodlums approached them and mistook them for High Flora, who had been recently sighted around
            Savage
            Terminal. The Hoodlums decided to rob the students, but Illium managed to defeat them all. He then demanded
            that they
            tell him everything that they knew about the other dimension. The terrified Hoodlums told him that the Nova
            would know
            more about it and begged him to let them go.

            Illium then took his friends to Pantheon, where they marveled at the strange architecture. Just then, Beldar
            spotted
            them and, mistaking them for High Flora, ordered the knights to arrest the children. The students explained
            that they
            were Verdant Flora, but Cartalion retorted that the Verdant Flora had been wiped out by Darmoor during the
            Fall of
            Aboris. Beldar added that the Verdant Flora were said to have nursed a vicious hatred for the High Flora,
            which had
            caused Darmoor's awakening as the Transcendent of Life and had brought destruction upon them all.

            Illium and the students protested that those were merely rumors, and that the survivors of the Verdant Flora
            had been in
            hiding for ages. Ex also added that unsubstantiated rumors were a foolish means by which to judge others.
            Irritated,
            Beldar told them that Heliseum didn't need the Verdant Flora's interference to survive. Morian pointed out
            that since
            they were all victims of Darmoor, they should be united against him. Cartalion then told Beldar to calm down
            and asked
            what they were all doing in Pantheon. Illium told him that they were looking for the other dimension, and
            that
            they
            would leave Pantheon as soon as they could, to which Cartalion ordered them to leave before sundown.

            Meanwhile, Kaiser had overheard the entire exchange and let Kylan know about what had happened. Kylan
            invited
            the
            students to the Great Temple and explained how Kaiser had mentioned that they were looking for information
            about the
            other dimension. He asked why they were looking for it, to which Illium responded that he was looking for an
            object that
            might be able to prevent Darmoor from causing further destruction. As their goals were united, Kylan told
            them
            that he
            would assist the students in going to the other dimension and asked them to bring him Gravi Stonegar Magic
            Stones.

            After giving him the materials, Kylan began to tell them about the other dimension when Beldar and Cartalion
            arrived.
            Cartalion reminded them that they had been ordered to leave Pantheon immediately, but Kaiser then stepped in
            and
            explained that the students had offered to help him with his mission. He told them that with the Magic
            Stones,
            the
            Interdimensional Portal had become much easier to activate. Beldar was still suspicious of the students, but
            Kylan told
            him that he believed them to be trustworthy. He then explained to Illium and the others that they would find
            the other
            dimension beyond the portal and cautioned them to take care. With that, the students entered the portal and
            emerged in
            the Six Path Crossway in Maple World.</p>

          <h3>Searching for the Sanctuary of the Ancient God</h3>
          <p>Upon arriving, they encountered Pilot Irvin, who asked them if they wanted to go to Gold Beach. Carnelian
            asked him if
            he could answer a few questions instead, but Irvin told them that he was busy and suggested that they ask
            Chief Stan in
            Henesys. The students went to see Chief Stan, who was amazed at their brilliant wings. They asked him if he
            had ever
            heard of the Sanctuary of the Ancient God, to which he explained that he had heard of the Temple of Rhinne,
            the Goddess
            of Time, in Leafre.

            However, he added that Rhinne was a goddess of Maple World and doubted that she was also the God of the
            Verdant Flora
            whom they were looking for, though he hoped that they would be able to find him one day. Having reached a
            dead
            end,
            Illium suggested that they all split up to look for clues. As the Crystal Gate in Professor Citrine's class
            that the
            students had all constructed together in class still remained, they decided to use the classroom as their
            hideout.

            After splitting up, Ex recommended that Illium first start his search in Gold Beach. However, even after
            thoroughly
            investigating Gold Beach, they were unable to find any trace of the Sanctuary of the Ancient God. Soon
            after,
            the
            students heard a rumor about the glaciers of Rien melting and decided to investigate. After helping save
            Riena
            Strait,
            Illium noted to himself that he was happy to have helped, though he was disappointed that they hadn't
            learned
            anything
            about the Sanctuary of the Ancient God.</p>

          <h3>Third Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Carnelian reached out to Illium and told him that she had made a new friend who had seen
            something similar
            to the Crystal Gate. They traveled to the Relic Excavation Camp in Perion, where Carnelian introduced them
            to
            Shuang, an
            archeologist working at the camp. Sinaria wondered whether the Crystal Gate could really be found in such a
            dust pit,
            but Carnelian snapped at her to not insult Shuang's work. Illium then told everyone to calm down and asked
            Shuang if she
            had seen anything like the Crystal Gate before.

            Shuang led them deeper into the excavation area where she had last seen the gate, but she was surprised to
            find it
            missing. They decided to wait for a while to see if the gate would appear, but after waiting for some time,
            Shuang asked
            them to help her with her work until the gate appeared. She explained that progress on the excavation had
            been
            slowed
            because of the monster attacks and asked Illium to defeat Wooden Boards and Rocky Masks. After helping
            Shuang,
            Illium
            and the others returned back to where they had been waiting.

            Soon enough, a Crystal Gate began to manifest before them. Dean stepped towards the gate, but it refused to
            open for
            him. However, it reacted to Illium and opened so that only he could enter. Illium then stepped into a white
            void filled
            with fog, where a large crystal glowed with power. From the void, he heard a voice telling him that he stood
            on hallowed
            ground, and that though he was weak and incomplete, the power of the Elder Crystal lay within him and with
            the
            Verdant
            Flora. With that, the power of the Ancient Master surged within Illium and pushed him outside the Sanctuary
            back into
            Maple World.

            As the other students rushed to see if he was okay, Illium confirmed that he had indeed entered the
            Sanctuary
            of the
            Ancient God. Sinaria excitedly asked him how they could get there, to which Illium told her that it had
            concealed
            itself, preventing him from reentering without searching for it again, much to Sinaria's annoyance. However,
            Carnelian
            pointed out that they had made progress. Illium thanked his friends for all their help in reaching the
            Sanctuary of the
            Ancient God, even if for a brief moment.</p>

          <h3>Joining the Alliance</h3>
          <p>Some time later, Neinheart contacted Illium and his friends and explained that he had heard about them from
            his sister,
            Lilin, who had mentioned how they had been helping people around Maple World, and how they had even helped
            her
            with the
            problem in Riena Strait. He then asked if they would be interested in meeting him in Ereve.

            After Illium arrived in Ereve, Neinheart told him that the Empress wanted to meet him. Cygnus then greeted
            Illium and
            explained that she wanted to recruit him into the Maple Alliance. Illium was surprised by her request, as he
            was from
            another dimension and wondered what he could do for Maple World. He also felt that it was unwise to fight
            for
            a
            different world, rather than for the Verdant Flora.

            Cygnus responded that she had heard from Kaiser that the people of Grandis were fighting against Gerand
            Darmoor. Illium
            told her that Darmoor was responsible for massacring his people, and that he was the sworn enemy of the
            Verdant Flora.
            Cygnus then asked if he knew that Magnus, the Nova traitor and a follower of Darmoor, had served as a
            Commander of the
            Black Mage.

            Illium was surprised to learn that Darmoor's reach had extended even to Maple World. Cygnus told him that
            both
            Darmoor
            and the Black Mage were evil beings who threatened the peace of both Grandis and Maple World, and that they
            needed to be
            stopped. She added that in exchange for his support, the Alliance would fight alongside him to liberate
            Grandis as well.
            Illium told her that he needed to discuss it with his friends first, and that he would give his answer soon.

            Back at the hideout, Illium heard his friends' opinions. Sinaria was against the arrangement, as she
            believed
            that they
            didn't have time to meddle with outsiders' affairs. However, Morian believed that the Alliance seemed
            powerful. Sinaria
            countered that they could become strong themselves and called him a coward for not believing in Illium.

            Illium told Sinaria that she was being harsh, and that with the Alliance's resources, they could find the
            Sanctuary of
            the Ancient God faster. Upon hearing this, Sinaria immediately changed her stance and agreed to join the
            Alliance.
            Illium and the others then returned to Ereve and told Cygnus that they would join her. She was pleased by
            their decision
            and officially welcomed them into the Alliance.</p>

          <h3>Ambush in Ereve</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Sinaria reached out to Illium and told him that she had learned that the Crystal Gate had
            recently appeared
            in Ereve. She urged him to rush over before the others so that he could catch it before it vanished. Illium
            arrived
            alone in Ereve and found Sinaria communicating with someone through a receiver. He overheard her saying,
            “…there's no
            problem… trust me… for the future… Verdant Floras…”

            Just then, Sinaria spotted Illium and led him to where the Crystal Gate was rumored to be. Ex noted that
            there
            was
            unusual energy in the area, but Sinaria dismissed it as energy from the Crystal Gate. Illium arrived to find
            a
            horde of
            Specters that rushed to attack them. He defeated them and pressed forward, but Sinaria quickly rushed ahead
            and told him
            to follow.

            Just then, more Specters surrounded him and Illium realized that it was a trap. Suddenly, both Ex and
            Machina
            were
            forcibly powered off. Without the support of his machines, Illium fought off the Specters alone and barely
            managed to
            defeat them. After the Specters disappeared, Ex and Machina were both able to power on again.

            Sinaria then appeared and angrily asked Illium why he hadn't followed her, explaining that the Crystal Gate
            had
            vanished. After he explained that the Specters had laid an ambush for him, Sinaria told him that the enemy
            had
            likely
            tried to lure them out by creating a fake Crystal Gate, which Illium found plausible.</p>

          <h3>Fourth Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>At the Sanctuary hideout, Illium and the other students discussed their findings on the location of the
            Sanctuary of the
            Ancient God. Carnelian reported that she had befriended several people at the Aquarium, and that they had
            told
            her about
            something glittering in the Deep Sea. There, they found a Crystal Gate that once again only allowed Illium
            to
            enter.

            Inside, Illium arrived in the Sanctuary of the Ancient God, where the voice of the Ancient Master told him
            that those
            who were bound by time's shackles could not enter, and that only Illium, as the Chosen One, had been
            permitted
            to enter
            the sanctuary. He explained that though Illium's time hadn't yet come, the time of the crystals had arrived.

            He then transferred his full power into the Elder Crystal before sending Illium back to Maple World. Illium
            then told
            his friends about what had happened, and though most of them were impressed that Illium was the chosen one
            of
            the
            Verdant Flora, Sinaria was intrigued to know that the crystals were awakening.</p>

          <h3>Ambush in Leafre</h3>
          <p>Some time later, Sinaria contacted Illium and reported that a Crystal Gate had been sighted in Minar
            Forest,
            and so the
            students all split up to search the area. Illium, Sinaria, and Morian searched the Burning Forest with Deus
            and Ex, but
            they were unable to find any trace of it. Suddenly, a horde of Specters arrived and Sinaria rushed towards
            them. Illium
            warned that it was too dangerous, but he was shocked to see that the Specters obeyed her.

            Just then, Darius arrived and stood beside Sinaria. He greeted Illium and told him that once he took the
            Elder
            Crystal
            and presented it to Gerand Darmoor, the Verdant Flora and the High Flora would reunite and achieve glory and
            power
            comparable to that of the ancient Flora, allowing them to rule all of Grandis. As Illium moved to attack,
            Darius used
            his magic to freeze him, Morian, Deus, and Ex in place.

            Darius then revealed that he had allowed Illium and the other students to escape Sanctuary, as he needed the
            Elder
            Crystal's power to mature while Illium trained in Maple World. Sinaria then told Illium that there was only
            one future -
            that which recognized the Flora as the superior race - and implored him to see that she and Darius were
            working for the
            future of the Flora.

            Darius added that he had underestimated Illium, as he could never have imagined that Illium was the heir to
            the God of
            the Verdant Flora's power. He invited Illium to join them in creating a new future for the Verdant Flora,
            claiming that
            they would be unstoppable together. However, Illium refused and told Darius that his vision of the future
            went
            against
            everything that Agate and the others had given their lives for.

            Realizing that he couldn't convince Illium, Darius attempted to seize the Elder Crystal for himself.
            However,
            Illium
            broke free of Darius' spell and defeated the entire Specter army with his full power. Furious, Darius vowed
            that he
            would never give up and disappeared with Sinaria.

            Some time later at the Aboris Royal Palace, a High Flora Priest reported to Gerand Darmoor that Darius had
            failed them
            and asked what could be done. Darmoor replied by saying, “The meaningless struggle of immature life… What a
            pathetic
            existence.”</p>

          <h3>Temple of Time</h3>
          <p>While exploring the Temple of Time, Illium's memories were drained by Dodo. After being told by the Record
            Keeper to
            return to where his adventure began, Illium realized that the beginning of his adventures had been when he
            had
            left
            Sanctuary. He recalled exploring Savage Terminal with his friends, after which the Nova had helped them use
            the
            Interdimensional Portal to arrive in Maple World.

            He then returned back to their hideout in Sanctuary, where he asked his friends if they remembered when they
            had first
            arrived in Maple World. Morian explained he had been thrilled to have finally found it after all their hard
            work. Dean
            added that it was when they had met the Nova, to which Illium nodded and agreed that he was glad that the
            Nova
            had been
            willing to help.

            Carnelian then asked him why he was asking all of a sudden, to which Illium replied that he had been
            thinking
            of when
            they had first begun their adventure. He noted that they had done very well for themselves since then, and
            that he
            believed that they were on the right track.</p>

          <h3>Final Quest</h3>
          <p>Ex told Illium that something was happening to the Elder Crystal and suggested that they move back to
            Sanctuary. There,
            a sudden flash of light emanated from the crystal and imbibed new power into Illium, marking him as the true
            owner of
            the Elder Crystal.</p>

          <h3>Fifth Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>Upon entering the Erda Flow and meeting with the Goddess of Maple World, the Goddess asks the player what
            it
            is that
            they cherish most in the world. Illium gets to choose between Morian, Ex, and Machina, or the people of
            Maple
            World.
            Despite only naming those three people for his first choice, his dialogue for that option has him also
            mention
            Dean,
            Carnelian, and Sinaria.

            Upon entering the Erda Flow and meeting with the Goddess of Grandis, the Goddess greets him and asks if he's
            come to
            unlock more of his mytocrystal's power.</p>

          <h3>Sixth Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>After the player frees the Goddess of Grandis, the Goddess will recognize Illium and greet him by name.</p>
