            <h1>Adele</h1>
            <p><b>Adele</b>, short for Adelaide, is a member of the High Flora race. She is a Warrior-type class who
              uses a
              Bladecaster as a
              primary weapon and Bladebinder as a secondary weapon.</p>

            <p>Centuries ago, Adele was a loyal Knight of the Einherjar - the royal guard of the God-King. During a coup
              to
              overthrow
              the God-King, Adele was sealed away in the Void for the crime of betraying her liege. In the present day,
              Adele
              is
              mysteriously freed from the Void in order to serve a new liege, a young man named Jerome who hopes to free
              his
              people
              from the vain Count Cedric. With all her memories erased from her time in the Void, Adele hopes to learn
              the
              truth
              behind what happened with the God-King and her supposed betrayal.</p>

          <h2>Story</h2>
          <h3>The Knights of the Einherjar</h3>
          <p>In her youth, Adelaide was a squire alongside a girl named Veronica. The two girls had the same sword
            instructor and
            trained to become knights. During one instance of their training, Adelaide knocked Veronica down while
            fighting,
            but
            when she tried to help Veronica up, their instructor chastised her for showing empathy to the opponent.
            Veronica
            angrily
            told Adelaide not to be a show-off.

            Some time later, both Adelaide and Veronica became Knights of the Einherjar, the personal guard of the
            God-King
            of the
            Flora. At their knighting ceremony, the God-King presented a token to each of the knights, modeled after the
            Einherjar,
            the gate to the royal palace, and told them that above all else, their duty was to protect the Einherjar.

            During one of their missions, Adelaide and Veronica had been tasked with hunting down a traitorous Knight.
            Though he
            begged for mercy, Adelaide struck him down without hesitation. Veronica was impressed by how coldly she had
            behaved, but
            Adelaide merely told her that she had fulfilled her duty as a knight, with no thought of vengeance.</p>

          <h3>Fall of the God-King</h3>
          <p>Several years into his reign, the God-King inexplicably underwent a dramatic change of personality. In his
            belligerence,
            he attempted to incite a war against the other races of Grandis. Adelaide watched in shock as the God-King
            denounced the
            other races of Grandis as savages, claiming that it was their responsibility to show the way. Struggling
            between
            her
            loyalty to the God-King and her own morality in waging an unjust war, Adelaide informed her liege that she
            could
            not
            follow him into battle. Furious, the God-King threw Adelaide into prison.

            During this time, Prince Gerand Darmoor convinced a faction of the knights to help him murder his father,
            claiming that
            it was the only way to stop the God-King from launching his genocide. In prison, Veronica visited Adelaide
            and
            gleefully
            mocked how she had fallen. However, she told Adelaide that she was giving a chance to help her escape prison
            and
            told
            her to expect company that night.

            That evening, the knights loyal to Darmoor freed Adelaide from prison, hoping that she would help them.
            However,
            Adelaide cut them down as traitors and rushed to defend her liege. As the rebellion began, Adelaide
            denounced
            the the
            traitors for having betrayed everything that the knights stood for.

            However, she and her knights soon fell in battle and the God-King was killed. Veronica then declared
            Adelaide
            a
            traitor
            for the crime of betraying the new God-King, Gerand Darmoor, and imprisoned her into the Void, where she
            spent
            centuries
            trapped as the magic of the Void carved her soul into a hundred and eight pieces. Over time, she felt her
            memories slip
            away bit by bit as she feared that soon, her entirety would vanish completely.</p>

          <h2>Main Story</h2>
          <h3>Escaping the Void</h3>
          <p>On the moon of Ristonia, a young man named Jerome was being chased by the Count's guards. As he found
            himself
            surrounded, Jerome denounced the guards' honor, claiming that their only allegiance was to the highest
            bidder.
            Just as
            the guards advanced on him, he made a desperate wish for help to the knight statue at the fountain square.

            In the darkness of the Void, his voice rang out and a golden light shined through, shattering Adelaide's
            chains
            and
            freeing her from the Void. She appeared before Jerome, who marveled that she was just like the knights from
            the
            old
            stories. When he asked her to save him, Adelaide claimed that she didn't know him, as he wasn't in the few
            memories that
            she had left. Just as the guards were about to attack, however, Adelaide heard a voice from the knight
            statue
            proclaim
            that her calling was to protect the crown and urged her to pull forth her blade. She then recalled her
            ability
            to wield
            swords from the Aether, after which she defeated the guards before escaping with Jerome.

            As they hid, Adelaide heard the guards refer to Jerome as a petty thief, yelling out that it would be better
            for
            him to
            turn himself in and pay for his sins. When Adelaide confronted him, Jerome stammered that she hadn't heard
            his
            side of
            the story yet. He added that he couldn't afford to get caught and told her that she would also get arrested
            with
            him if
            they surrendered. She conceded that the guards would consider her to be his accomplice, and that it wouldn't
            do
            to get
            caught while her memories were in a haze. Jerome told her to split up once he created a diversion and asked
            her
            to meet
            him at the fountain on the bell's fifth toll.

            After they escaped, Adelaide hid in a deserted plaza and recalled that the knight statue at the fountain had
            a
            voice
            which seemed to know her, just as she felt old power flowing into her. As she wanted answers immediately,
            Adelaide
            decided to go after Jerome instead of waiting for the designated time. She found him attempting to break
            into
            a
            building
            when he suddenly lost his footing.

            As he began falling, Adelaide shot a rope attached to an aether blade onto the building, allowing Jerome to
            grab
            onto it
            as he fell. She then watched him climb into the building through the window and quickly leave. Jerome was
            surprised to
            see her and defended his actions by explaining that he was returning a stolen item to its rightful owner.
            Suddenly, they
            heard a voice from the building marveling at the return of their family heirloom. Jerome explained that the
            family
            heirloom had been stolen by corrupt nobles.

            He then asked if Adelaide would serve as his knight in order to help him return the rule of justice to
            Ristonia.
            Adelaide told him that she didn't have time to get involved in other people's business, as she needed to
            discover who
            she was and why she had ended up in Ristonia. Jerome offered to help her find her memories, explaining that
            she
            could
            help him drive out the corrupt nobles while she traveled around the city to look for clues about her past.

            He told her that it had been nearly a decade since the nobles had filled the power vacuum after the king's
            death, with
            the royal family having collapsed soon after. While the nobles lived in opulence, they exploited the
            citizens
            by
            not
            only raising taxes, but also by slashing wages and protections for laborers.

            However, Jerome explained that it had been the legendary knights who had legitimized the king's claim to
            power,
            as he
            was just a man without their backing. Though Adelaide protested at his insistence that she would serve him,
            Jerome took
            her lack of denial as agreement. They disguised themselves in robes and began to retreat to his base.

            On the way, Adelaide began to explain what was left of her memories. Jerome was surprised at how little they
            had
            to go
            on, but he promised that he would ask his friends to look into it, as they were masters of investigation.
            Adelaide then
            agreed to help him, but only until she regained her memories. Jerome asked how she could be so cold, as she
            had
            the
            power to save an entire kingdom.

            He then remembered that he had meant to give her something and bestowed a knight's token, a necklace which
            he
            explained
            was a family heirloom, and told her that she could sell it for a handsome price if she decided that she
            couldn't
            trust
            him. He then realized that he had never asked for her name. When Adelaide told him her name, Jerome replied
            that
            it was
            too long to shout out in the middle of an emergency, and so he decided to call her Adele against her
            protests.
            He also
            told her that since his name was long as well, she could call him Jerome for short.

            At the fountain, he swore that he would use her power for the purpose of saving Ristonia. Adele then decided
            to
            play
            along until she got her bearings. After swearing their oath, Jerome welcomed her to Ristonia, Grandis'
            capital
            of art
            and culture. On the way back to his hideout, they found the way blocked by back alley cats.

            After defeating them, they arrived at the hideout of the Uprising, a revolution that Jerome had created in
            order
            to
            overthrow the corrupt nobles. There, one of the revolutionaries told Jerome that someone had been tearing
            down
            their
            fliers that denounced the nobles. Jerome told them not to worry, as they now had the support of a legendary
            knight.
            Adele was less than impressed by their small rag-tag militia, but she decided to entertain Jerome
            nevertheless.

            Jerome explained that his goal was to become the king of Ristonia and restore the kingdom to its former
            glory.
            He aimed
            to do so by eliminating the greedy nobles who plagued the people, Count Cedric in particular. He told Adele
            that
            before
            the royal family had collapsed, Cedric had been low-ranking royalty who had quickly risen to become the most
            powerful of
            the nobles in the absence of the royal family. As he was telling his story, Adele saw a flash of light and
            began
            to warn
            him of a possible attack. Jerome looked up to see a small creature floating about and laughed, explaining
            that
            the
            creature was named Boo, and that he had the power to transform into different kinds of objects. He then
            raised
            a
            toast
            for Adele joining their ranks.

            As the Uprising celebrated, Count Cedric marveled at his own beauty from within his residence. His
            manservant,
            Simon,
            was less than impressed by his master's soliloquy, reminding him that there was much to be done. Cedric told
            Simon that
            he trusted him to take care of those trivial matters on his own. Simon explained that he had taken care of
            them
            by
            staying up all night, but that this particular matter was something that only Cedric himself could address.

            He gave Cedric a document and asked for his signature, to which Cedric made it known how sick and tired he
            was
            of giving
            signatures. Simon added that he had managed to find three of the rare paintings that Cedric had asked for,
            but
            told him
            that the rest would be difficult to track down. Suddenly, the Count's guards arrived and reported that they
            had
            encountered a suspicious individual who had the power to wield floating blades. Cedric immediately
            recognized
            the
            description as being that of a legendary knight and asked Simon to investigate the matter for him.</p>
