            <h1>Kanna</h1>
            <p>Onmyouji Ayanokouji Kanna , or Kanna , is a playable character originating from Mark of Honor.
              With a Fan in her hand and her spirit fox Haku at her side, she calls on the strength of spirits to attack
              at
              her will.

              Kanna joined forces with the Sengoku Warriors in order to prevent Oda Nobunaga from becoming the Demon
              King.
              After the
              ritual was disrupted, the Sengoku Warriors were unexpectedly transported to Maple World. Under the
              leadership
              of
              Princess Sakuno, Kanna now helps the Sengoku Warriors defeat Oda Nobunaga and return back to their
              homeland.

          <h2>Main Story</h2>
          <h3>Battle at Honnou-ji</h3>
          <p>In the Sengoku era of the world of Sokoku, the Great Diviner, Abeno Seimei, had a premonition that a being
            would appear
            in the nation of Hinomaru with the power of the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven, threatening the entire
            realm.
            However,
            Abeno Seimei also had a premonition that five skilled heroes would rise to oppose Oda. These heroes were the
            Children of
            the Five Stars, each bearing a mark somewhere on their bodies that showed proof of their heavenly vessels.

            Centuries later, a warlord named Oda Nobunaga appeared and planned to become the Demon King of the Sixth
            Heaven. With an
            overwhelming military force, Hinomaru was quickly seized into hegemony. For the Demon King Ritual, Oda
            required a
            special sacrifice. Princess Sakuno was the first daughter of the Matsuyama clan and held an immense font of
            mana within
            her body.

            On Oda's orders, Sakuno was kidnapped and the Matsuyama clan was wiped out. Oda then brought Sakuno and his
            army to
            Honnou-ji, where he planned to perform the ritual that would grant him immortality and untold power.

            Hoping to stop him, a united military force of Daimyos, composed of the great lords Mouri Motonari, Uesugi
            Kenshin, and
            Takeda Shingen, formed an alliance called the Sengoku Warriors and led their armies to Honnou-ji Temple in
            order to put
            an end to Oda's ambitions. Kanna was the apprentice of the great Spirit Walker Tsuchimikado Haruaki, with
            whom
            she
            joined forces with Kenshin in order to stop Oda Nobunaga.

            Uesugi Kenshin arrived early at Honnou-ji with Haruaki and Kanna. Haruaki told Kanna to stop the ritual in
            the
            Western
            Wing, explaining that it would cause the power flowing into the temple to cut off. However, he warned that
            in
            order to
            fully stop the ritual, she would need to destroy the altar in the basement.

            Kanna arrived in the Western Wing, where she disrupted the flow of power, causing the barrier to weaken. She
            then fought
            past Oda's Spirit Walkers with her mystical fox, Haku. As she continued on, she noted that the barrier was
            continuing to
            collapse as a result of the other warriors succeeding in destabilizing it.

            Soon after, Kanna discovered the entrance to the basement hidden by magic. She easily dispelled the glamour,
            scoffing
            that such weak spells couldn't hinder her. Proceeding into the basement, Kanna discovered her former
            classmate, Mori
            Ranmaru, conducting the ritual to link Sokoku with the Demon Skies.

            The two Spirit Walkers began dueling, with Kanna attempting to destroy the altar and Mori defending it. As
            the
            battle
            dragged on, Kanna realized that their powers were too evenly matched for her to be able to destroy the altar
            in time.
            With no other choice, Kanna used her full power and had Haku unleash a devastating series of magical
            attacks.
            Though
            Mori blocked most of them, a single attack was able to slip past his defenses and destroy the altar, causing
            Princess
            Sakuno, who was being used as a conduit to the Demon Skies, to awaken.

            After Oda defeated Hayato, he noticed Sakuno attempting to disrupt the ritual and warned her of the
            consequences of
            doing so when the link to the Demon Skies was nearly complete. However, Sakuno merely told Oda that she was
            unconcerned
            with the ramifications and disrupted the ritual, creating a large beam of light that engulfed the temple and
            transported
            everyone to Maple World.</p>

          <h3>An Unfamiliar World</h3>
          <p>In Maple World, Kanna awoke in Zipangu to the sight of Haku. Soon enough, she encountered a man named Naoe
            Kanetsugu,
            who explained that the battle had been chaotic, and that he had seen someone fighting Oda, although he had
            no
            idea no
            way of knowing who it was. He congratulated Kanna for disrupting the ritual and told her that Akechi had
            planned to
            betray Oda and take all of Hinomaru for himself. He explained that Akechi had fought for hours as he
            attempted
            to reach
            Oda, though a large beam of light had erupted from the temple before he could enter, which had teleported
            them
            all to an
            unfamiliar world.

            He told her that he had arrived a few days ago, and that he had discovered her while searching for Kenshin.
            He
            then told
            her that those who had arrived earlier had set up a base nearby. Kanna wondered whether destroying the altar
            had caused
            the ritual to fail, though Haku told her not to blame herself, as she had done everything that she could.
            Kanetsugu then
            escorted her to their base, Momijigaoka, which he explained had been established by Mouri Motonari, one of
            the
            three
            leading Daimyos of the alliance. Kanetsugu then told her to go on and meet Motonari while he continued
            searching for
            Kenshin.

            Inside the base, Kanna approached Motonari and introduced herself as Haruaki's pupil. Unable to recognize
            her,
            Motonari
            immediately grew angry at Kanna inviting herself into the base, calling her a fool blundering in. Kanna was
            taken aback
            and explained that she had been sent by Kanetsugu. Motonari immediately apologized, though he asked her to
            first prove
            that she could handle herself, as the physics and energy of the new world was much different from their
            homeland.

            After training to recover some of her strength, Kanna was deemed fit to carry out missions by Motonari.
            Nevertheless,
            Kanna still felt that her strength had diminished greatly, though Haku noted that he felt perfectly fine and
            couldn't
            understand why everyone kept saying that they felt weaker. Kanna then decided to find her master and
            Princess
            Sakuno, as
            she feared that Oda had also come to the unfamiliar world. Just then, Motonari told Kanna that soldiers in
            dark armor
            had appeared in the area, though the strange light had left them lightly armed and disorganized.

            Kanna defeated the Oda scouts and collected some of their reports for Mouri, who was pleased to hear that
            Oda's forces
            were weakened by new world as well. After venturing outside again, she ran into Kanetsugu, who was on the
            same
            mission.
            Believing that Motonari had meant for them to complete, Kanetsugu ran off to win the supposed contest.

            After being egged on by Haku, Kanna rushed to defeat as many Oda scouts as she could, although Kanetsugu
            defeated her
            nevertheless. He then asked Kanna to return ahead to camp without him, as he wanted to find Kenshin as soon
            as
            possible
            before she starved in the wilderness. Refusing to be outdone, Kanna decided to find and defeat the
            high-ranking
            soldiers, hoping that it would force the scouts to retreat.

            As she proceeded deeper into the woods, she was surprised to encounter Kenshin, who was battling Oda's
            advanced scouts.
            Hoping to impress her, Kanna fought as many scouts as she could, ignoring Haku's protests that she couldn't
            compete
            against Kanetsugu, let alone someone as strong as Kenshin. Nevertheless, Kenshin was impressed and claimed
            that Kanna
            would have made a better pupil than Kanetsugu. She then asked Kanna whether she knew what had happened after
            the flash
            of light, to which Kanna told her that they had set up a base.

            She then escorted Kenshin to Momijigaoka, where Kanetsugu was both relieved and flustered to see Kenshin
            safe.
            Shingen
            then noticed Kenshin and remarked that Oda wasn't the only swamp rat to have made it through, calling
            Kanetsugu a lapdog
            when he jumped to defend Kenshin's honor. Motonari then broke up the quarrel and began explaining the
            details
            of the
            battle in the temple, as well as details about the new world. He then ordered them to put their rivalry
            aside,
            as they
            needed to focus on building their alliance to defeat Oda once and for all.

            Motonari then told Kanna that the Oda army had discovered the base, and though their forces were still weak,
            their
            numbers would soon overwhelm the base. As Kanna prepared for battle, she sensed a faint, familiar energy
            near
            the Oda
            base, Momijigahara. Surprised that the Oda army was already building a camp, Kanna decided to investigate
            what
            the army
            had brought with them to generate such energy. Fighting through the soldiers, Kanna discovered a mysterious
            foxtail and
            brought it to Motonari, who explained that warriors who had participated in the raids against the Oda forces
            had
            returned with similar tails.

            Suddenly, Kanna's master, Haruaki, emerged from the foxtail, much to everyone's surprise. Haruaki explained
            that he had
            arrived before everyone else, having been being transported at the same time as Oda and his forces. In order
            to avoid
            being discovered by Oda's men, Haruaki had disguised himself as a number of foxtails, though the Oda
            soldiers
            had taken
            a liking to the foxtails and brought them, and thereby him, straight into their camp.

            Having been rescued by Kanna, Haruaki began explaining the true purpose of the ritual. He explained that Oda
            had sought
            to conjure the Demon King of the Sixth Heaven from the Demon Realm, a world that was as different from their
            homeland as
            Maple World was. He explained that much like how it was possible to contact Maple World, Oda had sought to
            make contact
            with the Demon Realm through an ancient ritual.

            Upon discovering the Demon Realm, Oda had devised a plan to create a portal to the Demon Realm in order to
            bring the
            Demon King of the Sixth Heaven into their world, which was why Haruaki had launched the mission at the
            Honnou-ji Temple.
            Though he congratulated them on interrupting the ritual, he explained that no one could have predicted the
            consequences,
            which were that the gate to the Demon Realm had been warped, causing them to be transported to Maple World
            instead.
            Kenshin and Shingen both immediately resolved to defeat Oda, though Motonari reminded them that they needed
            to
            first
            regain their strength.</p>

          <h3>Finding Allies</h3>
          <p>Haruaki then took Kanna aside and confided in her that Princess Sakuno was not among them. Kanna was
            worried
            that Oda's
            men may have captured her, but Haruaki reassured her that Oda needed her alive, as the ritual required the
            blood of her
            lineage. He also reminded her that she needed to be ready, as the fates of both Sakuno and Oda rested on her
            shoulders.
            He then noted that the Oda men were well-nourished, whereas the people of Momijigaoka were struggling to
            obtain food.

            In order to remedy this, Haruaki decided to send Kanna on a mission to make alliances, regain her strength,
            and find a
            way to create a supply route. He instructed her to find a nearby town to the south of the camp, though he
            warned her
            that the enemy had likely created a pathway to get to it. Kanna then fought her way past the Oda forces and
            soon arrived
            at the Mushroom Shrine, where she encountered Kino Konoko. After exchanging greetings, Kanna asked Kino
            whether she had
            noticed anything strange in the area.

            Kino told her that a group of suspicious people had recently been spotted near the Mushroom Shrine. Kanna
            decided to
            investigate and encountered several Mecha Warrior Prototypes. After defeating them, she reported back to
            Kino
            and told
            her that they were likely not an immediate threat to the Mushroom Shrine. Kino then asked whether Kanna
            could
            investigate the mechanical ninjas in the area, whom Kanna determined to be hostile, numerous, and appearing
            to
            be
            searching for something.

            Realizing that the robots were a threat to the Mushroom Shrine, Kino asked Kanna to investigate several
            robots
            wielding
            guns. After defeating them, Kanna warned Kino that the gun-wielding robots were even closer to the Mushroom
            Shrine than
            the mechanical ninjas, and so she warned Kino to be cautious. Kino resolved to seek out long-term help and
            agreed to
            answer Kanna's earlier question about strange occurrences in the area. She explained that there was a
            constant
            influx of
            dirt blowing into the area, as well as a storm near the shrine, which she noted was an uncommon occurrence.

            Kanna realized that Oda must not have made contact yet and asked Kino to point her to the nearest shogun,
            explaining
            that she was a skilled Spirit Walker who could offer her services. Unsure of Kanna's strange question, Kino
            explained
            that the closest person to a shogun in Maple World was Empress Cygnus in Ereve. When Kanna was confused
            about
            what Ereve
            was, Kino jokingly asked whether Kanna wasn't from Maple World before giving her a book to help get
            acquainted
            with her
            new surroundings.

            Regarding Maple World itself, Kanna read that a suspicious aura had been reported near the Mushroom Shrine,
            exuding a
            sense of immense power surrounded by darkness and greed. Kanna wondered whether it could have anything to do
            with Oda
            Nobunaga. She also read about the Transcendents who maintained balance over the fundamental laws of light,
            life, and
            time. Kanna speculated that there might be other Transcendents that were yet to be discovered and wondered
            whether they
            could help the Sengoku Warriors return home.

            On the next page, she learned about Grandis and its three major races, the Flora, the Nova, and the Anima,
            as
            well as
            its three Transcendents and their statuses. Finally, she read about the Interdimensional Portal that
            connected
            Maple
            World and Grandis, lamenting at the possibility that there truly might not be a gateway that could return
            them
            home.
            Kanna then thanked Kino and resolved to visit the Empress. Believing that Kanna had greater need of it, Kino
            allowed
            Kanna to keep the book about Maple World.</p>

          <h3>Rescuing Sakuno</h3>
          <p>Before she could head out, however, Kanna received a letter from Haruaki ordering her to return to
            Momijigaoka
            immediately, as they had discovered the location of Princess Sakuno. Kanna immediately rushed back to base,
            where
            Haruaki told her that their scouts had sighted the princess imprisoned deep within the eastern wing of
            Honnou-ji. Though
            she fortunately appeared healthy, she was under tight watch by the Oda guards. Kanna immediately declared
            that
            they
            needed to launch a rescue operation, but Haruaki told her that they didn't have the strength, reminding
            Kanna
            that both
            she and the rest of their military forces needed more time to recover.

            Though he conceded that they had made several allies in Maple World, Haruaki explained that they couldn't
            draw
            them in
            so soon and risk fighting Oda with exhausted forces. Shingen then interjected that he agreed with Haruaki,
            adding that
            they couldn't risk their forces for a single person, even if it was Sakuno herself. However, he claimed that
            there was
            still a way and proposed sending a small group of elite warriors to infiltrate the enemy camp.

            With the other Daimyos in agreement, Shingen planned for the group to enter through the western Honnou-ji
            walls, but
            Motonari then suggested that they attack from the east, as Oda wouldn't expect them to strike at the same
            place that
            they had during the original Honnou-ji raid. Kanna volunteered to go, explaining that she was nimble and
            didn't wear
            armor. Kenshin agreed and ordered Kanetsugu to accompany Kanna.

            With the plan finalized, Kanetsugu moved in first to scout while Kanna followed. After she arrived, she
            rendezvoused
            with Kanetsugu, who told her that the security around the eastern wing was lacking, just as Shingen and
            Motonari had
            anticipated. He then left Kanna to rescue the princess while he secured their escape route, though he warned
            her to be
            cautious, as it was possible that the enemy's frail security might be a trap. Kanna covertly infiltrated
            Sakuno's prison
            and rescued the princess, but just as they were about to escape, an Oda guardsman discovered them and began
            to
            attack.

            After defeating him, Kanna led Sakuno through the escape route, where Kanetsugu met them and escorted them
            back safely
            to Momijigaoka. Back at the base, Sakuno met with the leaders of the Sengoku alliance and thanked them for
            the
            rescue
            operation. Having met them for the first time, Sakuno introduced herself as Matsuyama Sakuno, the eldest
            daughter of
            Matsuyama Nobukane and the acting head of the clans. The other Daimyos noted that Sakuno had a commanding
            presence in
            spite of her young age and remained hopeful that she would have the ability to lead the Sengoku alliance.

            Haruaki then asked Sakuno whether she had learned anything about Oda while she had been in his custody, as
            their own
            intel was severely lacking. Sakuno explained that even though the only person she had spoken to was the
            guardsman who
            delivered her meals, she had seen that Oda had been surrounded by many Spirit Walkers and conjurers,
            although
            nothing
            had seemed out of the ordinary. Haruaki then asked Kanna whether she had any questions for Sakuno.

            The princess was pleased to see Kanna again and noted that Haku had grown since their last meeting. Kanna
            began
            reminiscing about when she and her grandfather had first moved to Matsuyama territory. She recalled how
            Sakuno
            had
            always been desperate to leave the castle, noting that she herself would have traded everything to stay
            there
            for even
            one night, though she had been sent away to train as a Spirit Walker before she ever got the chance. She
            then
            pointed
            out the irony in Oda reuniting them and hoped that something good had come of the journey after all, with
            their victory
            over Oda finally allowing them to return to their homeland and resume their normal lives.

            Soon after speaking with Sakuno, Haku noted that Kanna's true skills were returning, adding that it was good
            because he
            was getting tired of doing all the work. Kanna amusedly asked Haku what he did besides sleep, to which Haku
            claimed that
            he did all sorts of things when he had enough mana, which he pointedly remarked that he was still waiting
            for.
            Kanna
            then realized that she ought to release some of the mana that she had stored up, as the weak magic that she
            had been
            using thus far wouldn't do for the difficult journey ahead.

            After releasing a small amount of her mana, Haku demanded to know whether Kanna intended to starve him, as
            he
            was
            nothing more than a house cat without mana. Kanna claimed that she wanted to be careful with how they used
            mana in Maple
            World, as there was no way of knowing how it would interact with the new laws of the strange land. However,
            she silently
            noted to herself that she had released as much as she could, acknowledging that it was hardly enough to
            defeat
            Oda and
            resolved to grow more powerful.</p>

          <h3>Traces of Akechi Mitsuhide</h3>
          <p>Deciding that she needed to learn more about Maple World before making her next move, Kanna began to
            explore
            Victoria
            Island and soon made her way to Henesys, where she met Athena Pierce at the Bowman Instructional School.
            Kanna
            greeted
            Athena and explained the situation which had led to her being transported to Maple World. Though Athena
            sympathized, she
            told Kanna that she had no idea about how to help and instead referred her to Grendel the Really Old, to
            whom
            she sent a
            note outlining her request for him to help Kanna.

            Kanna then traveled to the Magic Library in Ellinia,, where Grendel greeted her and recognized her from
            Athena's note,
            which indicated that Kanna was facing the threat of a demon. He asked what sort of demon Kanna was facing,
            citing
            Balrog, the Black Mage, and Pazuzu as many possibilities of the Demon King whom she was hoping to defeat. He
            then gave
            Kanna a list of books to read through, although she discovered that none of them had the answers she sought.
            Grendel
            apologized for not being able to help, though he hoped that she would find her answers when the time was
            right.

            Just then, Kanna received a letter from Athena Pierce, which stated that a suspicious man who seemed like he
            had come
            from Kanna's world was speaking with the Black Wings at the Golem Temple. Athena also wrote that he had a
            feminine
            appearance and a large sword. Kanna immediately headed to the Golem Temple and infiltrated Francis' hideout,
            where she
            fought and defeated the Puppeteer. She then asked Francis to tell her everything he knew of the strange man
            who had
            arrived earlier.

            Francis told her that the man had asked to join the Black Wings, though he had explained that he wasn't the
            one who made
            the decision to accept new members, and so he had passed the man's request on to the leader of the Black
            Wings. When
            Kanna asked him what the man's name was, Francis struggled to pronounce it and butchered it as “Akechyou
            Mister Heydey”.
            Puzzled, Kanna left the hideout and soon realized that Francis had meant to say that the man's name was
            Akechi
            Mitsuhide. She was surprised that Akechi wanted to ally with the Black Wings and realized that Oda's
            ambitions
            had grown
            to the point that he sought to control both Hinomaru and Maple World.

            She decided to return to the Bowman Instructional School and reported what she had learned to Athena,
            warning
            her that
            Oda sought to conquer Maple World. Athena replied that even though she didn't know much about Kanna's
            enemies,
            anyone
            who allied with the Black Wings was a threat to Maple World, and so she couldn't sit by and watch idly. She
            then pledged
            her support to Kanna as a citizen of Maple World and promised to spread the news and gather support from the
            people to
            come to her aid.</p>

          <h3>Riding Haku</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Haku told Kanna that their spiritual power was beginning to return, enough that he could
            maintain
            his
            original form. However, without a way to store the spiritual energy, Haku asked Kanna to seek out Kobayakawa
            Takakage
            for help. Kanna obtained a Spirit Shroom from Takakage, which she fed to Haku, allowing him to grow strong
            enough to let
            Kanna ride him.</p>

          <h3>Meeting with the Empress</h3>
          <p>As Kanna continued to grow stronger, she decided to seek out Empress Cygnus in Ereve. After arriving on the
            island, she
            spoke with Neinheart, who noted that he had never seen someone with as peculiar clothing as she was wearing,
            which
            reminded him of a report he had recently received from Zipangu from an informant that reported that a
            terrible
            storm had
            recently occurred there, with its aftermath bringing forth a new land. Realizing that Kanna was from that
            new
            land,
            Neinheart asked whether she was a friend or foe.

            Kanna reassured him that she was an ally and explained the story of how her land had been transported to
            Maple
            World, as
            well as the threat of Oda's army. Neinheart told her that he believed her, as her story lined up with the
            reports of the
            shift in the Black Wings' operations. He then allowed Kanna to meet Cygnus, who told Kanna that Oda's threat
            meant that
            the people of Maple World would need to rally together to defeat him. She also explained that she would need
            the full
            cooperation of the Sengoku Warriors and asked Kanna to deliver the message. Before Kanna could return to
            Momijigaoka,
            Neinheart reported that remnants of Oda's army had been sighted near El Nath and asked her to meet with
            Alcaster, who
            would provide further details.</p>

          <h3>Investigating the Black Wings</h3>
          <p>Kanna arrived in Orbis on her way to El Nath, where she encountered Kanetsugu, who explained that he had
            been
            sent by
            Haruaki to collect information from various places in Maple World. After he asked her about her tally of how
            many
            monsters she had killed, Kanna made up that she had killed 5,000 enemies, though Haku quietly scoffed that
            she
            had
            hardly killed 500. Impressed, Kanetsugu wished her well and continued on with his mission.

            Kanna then proceeded with her own and traveled to El Nath, where Alcaster informed her that Oda's forces
            were
            preparing
            for a ritual, and that one of them had the same outfit as hers, only black. Fearing that he was Mori
            Ranmaru,
            Kanna
            proceeded on and soon encountered several Oda Spirit Walkers with a Black Wings henchman. She noted that
            Mori
            wasn't
            present amongst them, and that they had enchanted several of the monsters nearby. The Black Wings henchman
            asked the
            Spirit Walkers who Kanna was, to which they claimed that she was an enemy and moved to attack her.

            After Kanna defeated them, she returned to Alcaster and reported that Oda had used spells to provoke the
            monsters from
            afar, as he was likely aware that she was tracking him. She also reported that she had encountered a
            rabbit-like
            creature and asked what it could be. Alcaster explained that it was a member of the Black Wings, adding that
            nothing
            good could come of Oda's alliance with them. Haku noted that Oda seemed to be making a spectacle of his
            schemes, with
            evil auras and menacing monsters loudly proclaiming his intent.

            Kanna replied that he had never been known to ally with other before and wondered why he needed such power,
            even going
            so far as to incorporate the monsters of Maple World into his plans. On her way back to report to
            Momijigaoka,
            Kanna ran
            into Kanetsugu and explained what had happened in El Nath. Kanetsugu explained that he had found similar
            evidence in
            Aqua Road and noted that Maple World was in grave danger. He offered to bring Kanna's report to the base
            along
            with his,
            allowing her to continue her investigations while he got to see Kenshin again.</p>

          <h3>Joining the Alliance</h3>
          <p>Kanna then continued growing stronger until she was contacted by Haruaki, who explained that the Empress
            wanted to speak
            with her. Kanna traveled to Ereve, where Cygnus explained that the Black Mage, who had once threatened Maple
            World, had
            returned again. Believing that the Black Mage would soon turn to attack other worlds, including Kanna's
            homeland, Cygnus
            extended an invitation to join the Maple Alliance. Kanna explained that it was the duty of a Spirit Walker
            to
            stop the
            evil spirits that tormented the people and declared that she would stand with Cygnus.</p>

          <h3>Darkness in Mu Lung</h3>
          <p>As Kanna continued regaining her strength, Princess Sakuno passed along a message from Neinheart, who had
            requested for
            Kanna's assistance in investigating Oda's army near Mu Lung. Kanna traveled to Mu Lung and spoke with Tae
            Sang, who
            explained that a group of suspicious people had passed through near the Peach Farm, and that they wore
            similar
            clothing
            to Kanna. Kanna then headed to the Peach Farm and spoke with Tae Soo, who explained that the Peach Monkeys
            and
            Reindeer
            had gone berserk after the suspicious group had passed through. Fearing that they would ruin the harvest,
            Tae
            Soon asked
            Kanna to calm the monsters down.

            After Kanna defeated the monsters, she returned to Tae Soon, who wondered why the group wanted to disrupt
            the
            harvest.
            He then sent Kanna to Do Gong at the Mu Lung Temple, as he kept watch over everything that happened in Mu
            Lung. Do Gong
            explained that Maple World's energy flowed strongest in Mu Lung, likening the town as the piece the held
            together the
            whole puzzle.

            Because of the threat to Mu Lung, Do Gong believed that Maple World's energy was the goal of the
            perpetrators.
            Their
            actions at the Peach Farm had led Do Gong to believe that they would soon be upon the forest, where the
            energy
            of Mu
            Lung flowed the strongest. He told Kanna to defeat the Sage Cats in the forest, who had been warped by Mu
            Lung's energy.
            While fighting the Sage Cats, Kanna found Oda's Clan Seal teeming with dark energy, which she brought to Do
            Gong.

            Do Gong realized that Oda's forces had been planning to warp the monsters of Mu Lung and realized that they
            were likely
            heading to the Goblin Forest, which was a sinkhole of energy. Inside the forest, Kanna was shocked to find
            Mori Ranmaru
            and demanded to know what he was planning. However, Mori countered by asking what he or Oda stood to gain
            from
            corrupting the monsters and allying with the Black Wings.

            Puzzled, Kanna began stammering that Mori caused chaos, but as she continued wondering what the reason for
            it
            was, Mori
            snapped at her, asking her whether she was blind and whether there had been chaos at Honnou-ji. His words
            caused her to
            recall Akechi Mitsuhide's rebellion, after which Mori told her that Akechi had left with a troop of Oda
            soldiers on a
            supposed reconnaissance mission moments before the battle at Honnou-ji had begun, explaining that Akechi had
            hoped to
            use the chaos created by the battle for his own ends.

            Kanna then realized that Akechi had been behind everything. Mori explained that he had been sent to Mu Lung
            in
            order to
            deal with Akechi, although he had found Kanna instead. Though he wished that he could defeat her, Mori said
            that he had
            more important business and warned her not to cross paths with him again.

            He then disappeared, but before Kanna could chase after him, King Sage Cat appeared and decided to punish
            her
            for
            trespassing into his territory. After Kanna defeated him and escaped, she was troubled to know that Akechi
            was
            yet
            another threat that they had to face. Soon after she sent a letter to Momijigaoka detailing what she had
            learned, she
            received one in response from Princess Sakuno, who thanked Kanna for uncovering the truth and reminded her
            that they
            needed to defeat both he and Oda.</p>

          <h3>Stopping Mori Ranmaru</h3>
          <p>Some time later, Princess Sakuno contacted Kanna and explained that Mori Ranmaru had been discovered. Kanna
            noted that
            she had seen him in Mu Lung and wondered what he was up to. Sakuno noted that Mori was once Kanna's
            classmate
            and asked
            whether it was difficult to face a former friend in battle. Kanna explained that she had never liked him
            from
            the
            beginning, which annoyed Haku, who asked why Sakuno could ask such a question when it would be considered
            impertinent
            for him to ask. Sakuno then told Kanna that Mori hadn't been seen near Honnou-ji in some time, though Sanada
            Yukimura
            had reported that he was preparing for a ritual deep in the mines of El Nath.

            Kanna traveled to the El Nath mines and spoke with Yukimura, who explained that Mori was preparing for an
            unknown
            ritual. He wondered whether Mori was planning to open the link to the Demon Realm, though he noted that it
            would be
            impossible without Princess Sakuno. Though Kanna dismissed Mori as foolish, Yukimura reminded her that in
            spite of his
            youth, Mori had great power and knowledge, as Oda accepting him into his ranks was proof enough. Kanna then
            confronted
            Mori and put an end to his ritual.</p>

          <h3>Temple of Time</h3>
          <p>While exploring the Temple of Time, Kanna's memories were drained by Dodo. After being told by the Record
            Keeper to
            return to where her adventure began, Kanna decided to return to Momojigaoka and spoke with Mouri Monotari,
            who
            noted
            that her strength had returned. He explained that he was nothing short of amazed at her fervor, adding that
            both Sokoku
            and Maple World would remember her name. He then told her that he was thankful for her dedication, as her
            loyalty was
            unexpected, and that he was glad that she was on his side.</p>

          <h3>Taking Honnou-ji</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Sakuno contacted Kanna once again and ordered her to return to Momijigaoka immediately, as
            Shingen had
            summoned the entire alliance. Back at the base, Shingen addressed the Sengoku Warriors and explained that
            Oda's forces
            had been broken, having lost Akechi Mitsuhide and several lesser generals. With Niwa Nagahide missing, only
            two of the
            Four Heavenly Kings remained: Shibata Katsuie and Takigawa Kazumasu. He also explained that he had just
            received word
            that Oda had moved his base out of Honnou-ji, and though Shibata was possibly in the area, Shingen expressed
            his
            confidence that they could take Honnou-ji for themselves.

            The Daimyos resolved to take the temple and sent their forces immediately. At the southern gate, the Daimyos
            gathered
            together, where Shingen told Kanna that because of her accomplishments in Maple World, she was the only one
            whom he
            could trust to create a diversion for their forces to charge in. Kanna entered the battlefield and fought
            the
            soldiers,
            allowing the Sengoku Warriors to follow. She then proceeded deeper and fought the samurai captains in the
            temple plaza.
            Shingen then asked her to defeat Takigawa and claim victory for their forces.

            Inside the temple, Kanna encountered Takigawa and urged him surrender, claiming that there was no reason for
            him to
            throw his life away for Oda. Reminding her that he was one of the Four Heavenly Kings, Takigawa rushed to
            attack. After
            a fierce battle, Kanna managed to defeat him. Kanna then demanded to know where Oda was hiding, but Takigawa
            laughed
            that he didn't know, as Oda would not be so foolish as to reveal his plans to mere footsoldiers. He
            explained
            that the
            only thing he knew was that Honnou-ji was worthless, collapsing soon after.

            News of the alliance's victory quickly spread amongst the troops as they all celebrated having retaken
            Honnou-ji. In
            Momijigaoka, Haruaki congratulated the alliance, though he noted that there was more work to be done, as Oda
            was missing
            and his base's location remained a mystery. He lamented that the only thing they had learned was that
            Honnou-ji once had
            great spiritual power, though it seemed to be gone. He speculated that if Oda had left Honnou-ji to find a
            new
            base, he
            would likely be looking for a location of great power.</p>

          <h3>Stellar Detectives</h3>
          <p>Kanna and Hayato joined forces with Chase, Jett, and Zen after PULSAR kidnapped, Nene, a mystical turtle
            with
            an immense
            font of mana. The group called themselves the Stellar Detectives and eventually discovered a large research
            ship which
            PULSAR had hijacked, where they were attempting to drain Nene's mana in order to create mutant clone copies
            of
            the
            mystical animal. The Stellar Detectives successfully rescued Nene and stopped PULSAR, although the Space
            Pirate
            Commander wiped their memories. Eventually, Kanna and the others regained their memories and vowed to stop
            PULSAR.</p>

          <h3>Black Heaven</h3>
          <p>Several days after the operation to rescue 10 Boogies, Princess Sakuno addressed the entire Sengoku
            alliance.
            Sakuno
            explained that a few days ago, she had received a letter from Neinheart that Maple World was being
            confronted
            by an
            incredible menace, and that the entire Alliance was moving to combat it. She added that Neinheart had also
            closed his
            letter with a request for help from the Sengoku Warriors. She then told the soldiers that even though Maple
            World wasn't
            their home, they had learned to appreciate it, as it had much of the beauty and tranquility of their
            homeland.

            In the name of the Matsuyama clan, Sakuno then ordered the Sengoku Warriors to claim an honorable victory
            over
            the Black
            Wings. Motonari, Shingen, and Kenshin immediately moved to mobilize their troops as Sakuno took Kanna aside
            and
            explained that Empress Cygnus had bestowed a special mission upon her.

            She told Kanna that Cygnus valued her spirit and powers, and so the Empress wished for Kanna to join her on
            the front
            lines. Though Kanna was grateful, she began asking whether her place was Sakuno, though the princess
            reminded
            her that
            it was a great opportunity for her to bring honor to the Sengoku Warriors. Kanna then swore on her family
            name
            of
            Ayanokouji that she would bring victory.

            After Athena Pierce and the player fight their way to the main deck, Athena gives a word of encouragement to
            the player
            as they charge into battle, which depends on their class. For Kanna, Athena tells her to show the enemies
            her
            power.</p>

          <h3>Vanishing Journey</h3>
          <p>After the player defeats Arma, Kao will speak to the player while being carried through the cave. Kao asks
            Kanna if she
            remembers when she had awakened with the power of the Seal Stone. Kao recalls her own life, and how she had
            shouldered
            the responsibility to save another dimension instead of her own. Though she hadn't shown it, Kao notes that
            it
            must have
            weighted on herself, and for good reason, as it was someone else's world and not her own.

            However, Kao adds that she had taken her responsibilities seriously, and though she wants to say that her
            heart had been
            true, she finds that she's not sure anymore. She then wonders whether there's someone better than her who
            can
            actually
            save the world. Kao then supposes that she had lost her worthiness the moment that her faith had wavered.
          </p>

          <h3>Labyrinth of Suffering</h3>
          <p>After Cygnus tells Neinheart that she will lead the fleet into Tenebris in the Adversary's place, Kanna
            gets
            exclusive
            dialogue, in which she notes to herself that the Empress is more resolved than ever. Thinking about her
            determination,
            Kanna reminds herself that they need to defend Maple World.

            When the player first meets with Azalin - Hilla disguised as a Night Walker - she will tell Kanna that she
            had
            always
            been surprised to hear that Kanna had helped Maple World so much, since she's not from around there. She
            adds
            that in
            any event, she knows that there are two sides, and so she asks Kanna which one she's on, laughing that
            she'll
            need
            allies who can help her out in a pinch. She then asks Kanna if she's hit a nerve before adding that she
            didn't
            mean it,
            and that she'd just been thinking out loud.

            After the Adversary collapses into despair as a result of Hilla's machinations, they pass out in a void of
            darkness
            within their own mind. As their morale and strength threaten to diminish completely, the mysterious divine
            light speaks
            to them in the form of someone close to them and provides them motivation to continue.

            For Kanna, the voice of Tsuchimikado Haruaki asks her why she risks her life to save others. Kanna tells him
            that it's
            because everyone is that precious to her, to which Haruaki asks her why she cares so much for Maple World.
            He
            points out
            that it isn't her home and asks her why she would go so far. Kanna replies that Maple World is the home
            where
            her loved
            ones live, and that it's a precious place, filled with all their memories.

            Haruaki asks her if she can remember what she needs to do now, to which Kanna begins to say hopelessly that
            everyone is
            already dead, and that she couldn't protect anyone. She adds that there's nothing that she can do, and that
            she's
            completely helpless. She then asks what someone like herself can do, to which Haruaki tells her to open her
            eyes and see
            for herself, explaining that even if Hilla covers her eyes, she can never cover the truth.

            He asks her to open her eyes, get up, dust herself off, and do what she has to do, reminding her that the
            way
            of the
            Spirit Walker is to think not of themselves, but of the peace of the world, and that their path only
            concludes
            at the
            end of the Spirit Walker's life. He promises Kanna that her spirit will not fail her and tells her that all
            roads exist
            inside her heart, and to never forget that. As the voice fades away, Kanna recognizes the voice as belonging
            to Master
            Haruaki.</p>

          <h3>Limina</h3>
          <p>When the Adversary faces the Black Mage, he tells them that their path has always been preordained. In
            response to his
            words, Kanna vows that she'll transcend the destiny that he's created for the sake of everyone who calls
            Maple
            World
            home.

            In the final act of Limina, the Adversary (your character) dies after defeating the Black Mage. The
            Adversary
            wakes up
            in the Erda Flow, serving as the afterlife, where the White Mage thanks you for putting an end to the
            battle.
            After the
            conversation, he gives you a unique title based on your class; the title he gives to Kanna is "Fated Master
            of
            Spirits".

            After the battle of Tenebris, the Adversary will meet with Neinheart and several members of the Alliance,
            which is
            dependent on the player's class. For Kanna, Neinheart tells her that all of Maple World owes her a debt that
            can never
            be repaid. Cygnus adds that peace has been brought back to Maple World because of people from other worlds
            like her, for
            which she has Cygnus' utmost gratitude. Princess Sakuno then arrives, much to Kanna's surprise, and replies
            that they
            stand together as one Alliance.

            She explains that Maple World has accepted them, and so it's only right for them to return the favor. She
            then
            turns to
            Kanna and notes that she's saved the world yet again, adding that she couldn't be prouder. Cygnus thanks
            Sakuno and
            promises that the Alliance will be there when the Sengoku Warriors need help, just as Kanna and the Sengoku
            Warriors
            have done. Sakuno replies that she doesn't need a reward for helping her comrades, though she adds that she
            appreciates
            the sentiment.</p>

          <h3>Aftermath</h3>
          <p>Several days after the victory at Tenebris, Princess Sakuno addressed the Sengoku Warriors at Momijigaoka.
            She told the
            soldiers that when they had first joined forces with the Alliance, their goal had simply been to vanquish
            Oda
            Nobunaga,
            and that they never would have suspected that their battle would have taken them to Maple World, where they
            would meet
            new enemies and allies alike. Having fought with the Alliance, she proudly proclaimed that they had
            vanquished
            the Black
            Mage, whom she called the greatest evil of all. She then congratulated the troops for their dedication
            before
            presenting
            Kanna, whom she described as having led the battle with courage and honor.

            As the soldiers cheered Kanna, Shingen noted that the time for celebration was upon them. Yukimura also
            proudly told
            Kanna that she had been impressive, and that he could learn much from her. Kenshin warmly told Kanna that
            she
            had become
            a blade of justice to cut down her foes, though Kanetsugu stubbornly reminded her that she still wasn't as
            great as
            Kenshin. Haruaki then told Kanna that she had exceeded all expectations, even exceeding his wildest dreams.

            Motonari proudly noted that the Sengoku Warriors were now feared and renowned worldwide, which was an
            excellent position
            for them. However, Sakuno then reminded the crowd that the path ahead was still difficult, as Oda Nobunaga,
            Akechi
            Mitsuhide, and the villains of Grandis were still enemies that they were yet to face. However, she
            proclaimed
            that their
            unbreakable bonds of unity would see them prevail the battles ahead. With that, she declared that they would
            celebrate
            their victory in Kanna's honor.

            Later that night, Kanna was standing amidst the cherry blossom trees when Haku pointed out Hayato standing
            on
            the castle
            balcony with Princess Sakuno. He then proposed that they sneak up and eavesdrop on the conversation, though
            Kanna
            scolded him for suggesting it, reminding him that eavesdropping was wrong, and that it would be rude to
            Sakuno. Haku
            pouted over Kanna worrying about Sakuno, asking when the last time was when she had tended to his needs by
            feeding him
            Star Candy. Amused, Kanna fed several pieces of candy to Haku, who was placated.

            Just then, Haruaki found Kanna and approvingly noted that she was enjoying the party. He then commended
            Kanna,
            explaining that she had saved the world and honored the ways of the Spirit Walker in the process. He then
            asked how she
            had found her way when she had entered the heart of chaos, where evil flowed freely. Kanna admitted that it
            had been
            difficult, as there had been times at the darkness had been so great that she could no longer see the cycles
            of the
            spirit.

            However, as she had continued stumbling blindly, a single light had pierced through the darkness, which had
            embodied the
            hopes, dreams, and determination of everyone who had been counting on her. As an afterthought, she added
            that
            Haku had
            helped as well, to which Haku wagged his tail and proudly proclaimed that he had indeed. Haruaki warmly
            smiled
            and noted
            that he couldn't have done a better job himself. However, he added that her journey as a Spirit Walker was
            far
            from
            over, as there were still many evils in the world. With that, he excused himself, explaining that he was
            needed
            elsewhere.</p>

          <h2>Specialty</h2>
          <p>Like Demon Slayer's Demon Fury, Kanna has a special form of Mana. The only way for her to regain Mana is by
            natural
            regeneration via Manaflow or via Mana Balance.</p>
