            <h1>Dual Blade</h1>
            <p><b>Dual Blade</b> is a special branch of the Explorer Thief class. The Dual Blade is created separately,
              has
              a separate
              tutorial, and has a few intermediate job advancements in addition to the usual 5. Their first job+ is
              Blade
              Recruit,
              their second job is Blade Acolyte, their second job+ is Blade Specialist, their third job is Blade Lord,
              and
              their
              fourth job is Blade Master.</p>

            <p>The Dual Blades are a rogue faction of thieves who follow Lady Syl, the daughter of the former Dark Lord,
              who
              believes
              that Jin, the current Dark Lord, killed her father and took his place. Their base is in the Secret Garden
              that
              can be
              accessed through a portal in Kerning City.

              As Special Explorers, Dual Blades have their own storyline and also follow the regular Explorer storyline
              as
              well.

              An Explorer from Maple Island gets convinced by a Dual Blade named Ryden to join their ranks. As the Dual
              Blade rises
              through the ranks, they soon uncover the real truth behind the former Dark Lord's death and eventually
              help
              unify the
              Dual Blades with the thieves of Kerning City.</p>

          <h2>Main Story</h2>
          <h3>Secret Suggestion</h3>
          <p>An Explorer hoping to become a thief was recruited by a man named Ryden, who instead convinced the Explorer
            to follow
            Lady Syl, rather than the Dark Lord. Ryden brought the Explorer before Lady Syl, who told them about her
            feud
            with the
            Dark Lord. She explained that the title of ‘Dark Lord' was handed down from generation to generation, each
            serving to
            guide the thieves through the darkness. As the daughter of the former Dark Lord, she had watched her father
            lead both
            the Dual Blades and the other thieves.

            She explained that her father, Sung, was a Dual Blade, and that he would have likely picked another Dual
            Blade
            as his
            successor. Because of this, his apprentice, Jin, had murdered him and had stolen his position as Dark Lord,
            with the
            rest of the Dual Blades going into hiding after the incident. She told the Explorer that she hoped to get
            her
            vengeance
            by building up the Dual Blades' strength and driving Jin out of Kerning City.

            However, as Jin was quite popular with the citizens of Kerning City, she feared that the people would defend
            him if the
            Dual Blades were to attack. As harming innocents was something that she wanted to avoid, Lady Syl told the
            Explorer that
            she needed a spy to infiltrate Kerning City and serve under the Dark Lord in order to undermine him. After
            the
            Explorer
            accepted her mission, Syl sent them to train under Ryden.

            Ryden first ordered them to hone their observational skills by having them distinguish a toy playhouse that
            was slightly
            different from the others. Next, he had them practice their stealth by making it through an obstacle course.
            Then, he
            had them defeat a Training Mano in order to sharpen their combat skills. Finally, he had them take a test of
            loyalty by
            drinking a poison and seeing Lady Syl for the antidote. However, upon visiting Lady Syl, they were informed
            that Ryden
            had merely given them apple juice, though she emphasized that the point was that they should never think of
            betraying
            her.

            After passing the initiation trials, the Explorer became a Dual Blade under Lady Syl's tutelage. As they had
            not yet
            learned any Dual Blade techniques, Syl believed that they were in the perfect position to serve under the
            Dark
            Lord as a
            new thief. Ryden then tasked the Dual Blade with learning more about the Dark Lord by interrogating his
            closest
            associates of Kerning City: Nella, JM from tha Streetz, and Don Giovanni.

            The Dual Blade first spoke with Nella, who asked them to defeat the Stirges attacking the Pharmacy. After
            helping her,
            they learned that she viewed the Dark Lord as kind and trustworthy. Next, they spoke with JM, who asked them
            to obtain a
            Thin Jr. Necki Skin. The Dual Blade obtained one from Taeha, the Dual Blade merchant, and brought it back to
            JM. They
            then questioned him and learned that the Dark Lord obtained a delivery package once a week from out of town.

            Finally, the Dual Blade visited Don Giovanni at the hair salon Giovanni asked the Dual Blade to obtain a Toy
            Plane for
            his son, Icarus, who dreamed of flying. The Dual Blade obtained the toy from Taeha and brought it to
            Giovanni,
            who
            thanked them for their help. Upon being questioned about the Dark Lord, Giovanni explained that he
            occasionally ran into
            the Dark Lord walking by himself in the Swamp Region.

            After reporting back to Ryden, the Dual Blade was instructed to wait until he finished investigating the
            leads.
            Meanwhile, Lady Syl noted their talent and called them to learn the art of dual-wielding. She first tasked
            them with
            obtaining a Mirror of Insight from within one marble amongst many, which indicated that they were worthy of
            learning the
            way of the Dual Blade. After they were initiated into the ranks of the Dual Blades, Ryden contacted them and
            suggested
            that they train around Victoria Island and grow stronger.</p>

          <h3>The Unspeakable Truth</h3>
          <p>Soon after, the Dual Blade was contacted by Yun, Lady Syl's sister, who asked them to speak to Lady Syl on
            her behalf.
            She explained that Syl lately seemed to be in a bad mood quite often, and as Syl seemed to trust them, she
            hoped that
            speaking to her would cheer her up, as Yun believed that Syl would feel worse if she knew that her sister
            was
            worried
            for her.

            Just as Yun had hoped, Syl was pleased to see the Dual Blade and explained that her father used to tell her
            stories from
            the past whenever she felt depressed. She told them that thinking about her father made her feel better,
            though her
            memories of him had lately been slipping away. She confessed that she had even lost the memory of the day
            that
            he had
            passed, noting that it was strange, as she couldn't remember the details, even though she remembered the
            events. She
            wondered whether it was because of the trauma of losing him, or of Jin's betrayal.

            She explained that she did remember that the morning of that day, her father, his best friend - Tristan -
            and
            Jin had
            gone to Sleepywood in order to face Balrog. Though she had wanted to accompany them, her father had
            forbidden
            it, though
            she had secretly followed them anyways. As she hadn't been able to enter the cave, she had chosen to
            eavesdrop
            outside,
            though the very next thing that she remembered was coming out of a haze and seeing Jin holding a
            blood-stained
            sword,
            with her father and Tristan dead.

            She told the Dual Blade that she would never forget Jin's look of shock, adding that he likely must have
            killed Sung and
            Tristan while they had been weakened from facing Balrog. She noted that she thought of that moment every
            single day, and
            that she even dreamed about it, though she hoped that her flowers would help calm her dreams. She then asked
            them to
            leave her in peace, adding that Ryden had a new mission for them.

            Ryden told the Dual Blade that the Dark Lord had been stealing their information, for which Ryden planned to
            strike
            back. He told them that he would lure the Dark Lord out of his headquarters, the Jazz Bar, while they
            searched
            the
            premises for clues. In the Jazz Bar, the Dual Blade found a hidden room and obtained the Dark Lord's diary,
            which they
            brought back to Ryden.

            After reading the diary, Ryden told them that the Dark Lord had mentioned the owner of the bookstore, Jeppi,
            whom the
            Dark Lord had banished some time ago. Believing that Jeppi had learned the truth about the Dark Lord's
            treachery, Ryden
            hoped to find him. As they had no leads on his location, Ryden asked them to speak with Mr. Pickall, whose
            store had
            been next to Jeppi's.

            Mr. Pickall told the Dual Blade that Jeppi had moved to Ellinia, where he lived inside the Giant Tree. The
            Dual Blade
            traveled to Ellinia and met with Jeppi, whom they intended to rescue. However, Jeppi explained that it was
            all
            a
            misunderstanding, as the Dark Lord hadn't banished him, but rather, he had sent him away for protection from
            an unknown
            threat.

            He revealed that from the shadows, someone had been twisting the history of Maple World, and that Sung had
            been hunting
            them down alongside Jin. He explained that he had helped them with his knowledge of history books by telling
            them about
            any inconsistencies, adding that Maple World's history had been deeply distorted.

            He told the Dual Blade that with the help of several citizens of Sleepywood, including Tristan, Sung had
            intended to
            lure out the threat and destroy it. However, the enemy had been aware of their plan and had tricked them,
            resulting in
            the deaths of both Sung and Tristan. Upon seeing how dangerous the situation was, Jin had helped hide Jeppi
            somewhere
            safe while he continued the fight alone.

            The Dual Blade then reported back what they had learned to Ryden, who was immediately dubious. In order to
            validate the
            story, he sent the Dual Blade to meet Tristan's apprentice in Sleepywood. At the bottom of the Cursed
            Temple,
            the Dual
            Blade encountered the spirit of Tristan, who explained that it hadn't been Jin's fault, as all of them had
            underestimated their enemy, who had the ability to possess others.

            He revealed that the enemy had possessed Syl, who had been eavesdropping on them from outside. As they
            hadn't
            warned her
            about the enemy's powers, she hadn't been able to shield her mind, causing her to grow possessed. With a
            cold
            smile on
            her face, she had slaughtered him and Sung, as neither of them had been willing to hurt Syl.

            Tristan believed that the enemy had left Jin alive to teach the world a lesson, and that it had left Syl
            alive
            as a
            reminder of their weakness. Following the tragedy, Jin had been forced to continue his pursuit of the enemy
            in
            secret,
            while Syl had been left to believe in a lie. As proof of his claim, he asked them to obtain his keepsake
            from
            Mu Young.

            Mu Young instructed the Dual Blade to obtain the keepsake in storage, where the Dual Blade encountered
            several
            Black
            Wings henchmen. After defeating them, they returned back to Mu Young, who noted that the storage room had
            already been
            looted of its valuables years ago. He then asked them to keep the keepsake – his master's diary.

            The Dual Blade returned back to Ryden and told him what Tristan had explained. They also gave him Tristan's
            diary, which
            confirmed Jeppi's story. He noted that the truth would devastate Lady Syl, as the thought of vengeance was
            the
            only
            thing that kept her going. He instructed them to say nothing for the moment until he found the best way to
            share the
            truth with her. He then asked them to accompany him to visit Jin and speak to him personally.

            In the Jazz Bar, Ryden confronted Jin and demanded to know why he had kept the truth from Syl, even while
            knowing that
            she was planning to kill him. He asked Jin whether he had intended to tell her the truth at the last
            possible
            moment
            when she would come to fight him, adding that he would make her look like a fool by doing so.

            The Dark Lord was hesitant upon hearing Ryden's words, though he asked whether Syl would have benefited by
            knowing the
            truth that her father had only died because she had been taken hostage. He explained that though Syl was now
            strong, she
            had once been overwhelmed by the pain of losing her father, adding that he had hoped to avoid making her
            feel
            worse by
            telling her the truth. Ryden retorted that nevertheless, the Dark Lord had no right to keep the truth from
            her.

            The Dark Lord apologized, noting that he should have told her sooner. However, he added that he had only
            wanted to keep
            her from feeling any more pain than she already had. Ryden noted that though Syl needed to be told the
            truth,
            he feared
            that it would make her nightmares even worse. He then asked the Dual Blade to deliver his report to her,
            believing that
            it would be better coming from them. Just as Ryden had suspected, Lady Syl's face grew pale as she read the
            report.
            Nevertheless, she thanked the Dual Blade for their work and asked them to leave her to collect her thoughts.
          </p>

          <h3>2nd+ Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>Some time later, Lady Syl contacted the Dual Blade and asked them to return to the Secret Garden, where she
            promoted
            them to Blade Specialist. She noted that it seemed ironic that they had grown stronger, even when she had
            initially
            doubted them, while she had grown strangely smaller. She explained that her father used to tell her that
            Dual
            Blades
            used two weapons so that they were better equipped to protect others, though she quickly realized that she
            was
            rambling.</p>

          <h3>3rd Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Lady Syl told the Dual Blade that she had decide to unite the thieves and the Dual Blades,
            believing that
            they would be stronger as one group. However, she admitted to them in private that the decision had been
            quite
            difficult, as she had grappled with the revelation that her worst enemy was actually the one who had saved
            her, which
            had wounded her pride greatly.

            She explained that all her plans, schemes, and emotions had been based on a lie, for which she couldn't
            forgive Jin, who
            had made a fool of her. However, she added that she knew that she couldn't let her feelings sway her, as she
            needed to
            do what was best for her people. Before they could move forward, however, she told them that she couldn't
            abide knowing
            that Jin had kept the truth from her because he had believed her to be weak. She then asked them to defeat
            the
            Dark Lord
            in order to prove the Dual Blades' strength, which would satisfy her need for revenge.

            The Dual Blade confronted the Dark Lord and told them about Lady Syl's decision. Jin noted in satisfaction
            that Syl had
            matured for her to look past her anger and unite together. He then invited them to face him and summoned a
            weaker clone
            of himself. After the Dual Blade defeated the clone, the Dark Lord admitted that the Dual Blades and Syl
            were
            stronger,
            after which officially welcomed the Dual Blades back into the fold of thieves.</p>

          <h3>Black Heaven</h3>
          <p>In the Secret Garden, Lady Syl gave a speech to the entire organization. She told them that the Dual Blades
            had been
            born out of a simple misunderstanding, but since then, they had resolved the matter and were now on good
            terms
            with the
            Dark Lord. However, she reminded them that they couldn't forget their roots, adding that the operation was
            their chance
            to show all of Maple World why the Dual Blades existed. She commanded them all to achieve victory, claiming
            that it was
            high time that they came out of the shadows.

            Later on, she called the Dual Blade and gave them another mission. In the impending battle, she believed
            that
            their
            enemies were the same ones whom her parents had fought. Though she wanted to slay them herself, she didn't
            know if she
            could endure their mental attacks, and so she asked them to strike her down if she became possessed.
            Hesitantly, the
            Dual Blade agreed to her request.

            the player
            as they charge into battle, which depends on their class. For Dual Blade, Athena tells him to show their
            enemies his
            skills as an Explorer.</p>

          <h3>Labyrinth of Suffering</h3>
          <p>After the Adversary collapses into despair as a result of Hilla's machinations, they pass out in a void of
            darkness
            within their own mind. As their morale and strength threaten to diminish completely, the mysterious divine
            light speaks
            to them in the form of someone close to them and provides them motivation to continue.

            For the Dual Blade, the voice of Lady Syl asks him why he risks his life to save others. The Dual Blade
            tells
            her that
            it's because everyone is that precious to him, to which Lady Syl asks him why he cares so much for Maple
            World, and what
            his purpose is. The Explorer replies that Maple World is the home where his loved ones live, and that it's a
            precious
            place, filled with all their memories.

            Lady Syl asks him if he can remember what he needs to do now, to which the Dual Blade begins to say
            hopelessly
            that
            everyone is already dead, and that he couldn't protect anyone. He adds that there's nothing that he can do,
            and that
            he's completely helpless. He then asks what else he can do, to which Lady Syl tells him to open his eyes and
            see for
            himself, explaining that even if Hilla covers his eyes, she can never cover the truth.

            She asks him to open his eyes, pick himself up, and do what he has to do, reminding him that they are the
            Dual
            Blades,
            and they're united as one right behind him. She then tells him that all roads exist inside his heart, and to
            never
            forget that. As the voice fades away, the Dual Blade recognizes the voice as belonging to Lady Syl.</p>

          <h3>Aftermath</h3>
          <p>In the Secret Garden, Lady Syl commended the Dual Blade for defeating the Black Mage and for bringing honor
            to the Dual
            Blades. The Dual Blade told her that he had merely fulfilled his duty, but Syl told him that he had done far
            more than
            that, having inspired her to move the Dual Blades out of the shadows. She admitted that she had even started
            visiting
            the Jazz Bar in Kerning City from time to time, having buried the hatchet with the Dark Lord. She then told
            the Dual
            Blade that she looked forward to hearing of his next victory.</p>

          <h2>Story (Old, Pre-Justice)</h2>
          <h3>Main Story</h3>
          <p>An Explorer on Maple Island received a letter from an anonymous sender, who claimed that their organization
            had been
            watching their development, and that they had decided to give them a chance to join. They explained that
            Kerning City
            had been under the control of the Dark Lord for generations, and that the current Dark Lord was unfit to
            lead.
            They
            claimed that Lady Syl was the true master of Kerning City, and that the mission of the Dual Blades was to
            help
            her take
            back her rightful place.

            The letter also explained that the Dual Blades had been gathering information that would help in the fight
            against the
            Dark Lord and his missions. It then tasked the Explorer with infiltrating the Dark Lord's organization and
            obtaining
            information about him by becoming one of his thieves. The Explorer then became a thief under the Dark Lord
            and
            began
            working to gain his trust while secretly working for the Dual Blades.

            In order to get closer to the Dark Lord, the Dual Blade learned that the Spores were causing him trouble by
            stealing
            from the townspeople and pulling pranks on them. In order to gain his trust, the Dual Blade defeated the
            Spores around
            Victoria Island, after which they were contacted by Ryden - the man who had recruited them to join the Dual
            Blades.

            In the back alleys of Kerning City, Ryden told them that Lady Syl was the only child of the former Dark
            Lord,
            and that
            the Dual Blades were working to help her reclaim her birthright. He explained that the people of Kerning
            City
            respected
            the current Dark Lord, and that the Dual Blades were working to expose his true nature.

            In order to hear the people's opinions on the Dark Lord, as well as to find people who might doubt him, the
            Dual Blade
            first spoke with Nella, who strongly believed that the Dark Lord was a good man. However, she noted that he
            always
            remained in the Jazz Bar, which made her wonder whether he had a secret. She then asked the Dual Blade to
            speak with JM
            From tha Streetz about the Spores that had recently popped up. JM told them that according to rumors, the
            Spores had
            stolen something that belonged to the Dark Lord, which explained why he was so eager to catch them.

            In order to learn more about the stolen item, the Dual Blade spoke to Mr. Pickall, who revealed to them that
            the Dark
            Lord was a title handed down through generations, with the current Dark Lord being the 8th in the line,
            having
            been a
            disciple of the 7th Dark Lord, who had mysteriously disappeared, along with his daughter.

            The Dual Blade reported back to Ryden, who told them that the Dark Lord had learned about the existence of
            the
            Dual
            Blades. In order to learn what the Dark Lord was planning to do, the Dual Blade met with the thief job
            instructor at the
            Construction Site.[10] The Dual Blade spoke with the thief instructor by pretending to have been sent on the
            Dark Lord's
            instructions to investigate the Dual Blades.

            The thief instructor explained that though the Dual Blades kept themselves well-hidden, he had noticed that
            Ryden was
            exhibiting suspicious behavior in the alleyways. The Dual Blade then reported back to Ryden, who gave them
            several
            falsified maps to bring to the job instructor, who thanked them, believing that the maps led to the Dual
            Blade
            hideout.

            Soon after, Ryden told the Dual Blade that Lady Syl hadn't been sleeping well because of the Wraiths that
            haunted her
            dreams. The Dual Blade eliminated the Wraiths in the subway, though Lady Syl's condition still wasn't
            improving because
            of her weakness. In order to help Ryden prepare a traditional Kerning City tonic for her, which was made
            from
            Octopus
            Tentacles boiled for three days and three nights, and mixed with special herbs from Dark Stumps, the Dual
            Blade
            collected the necessary ingredients from the monsters.

            After helping Ryden prepare the tonic, the Dual Blade was tasked with placing posters around Kerning City,
            as
            well as a
            bomb in the Jazz Bar, which was meant only to serve as a warning that the Dark Lord was to be punished, not
            to
            kill
            anyone. After the bomb detonated and caused an uproar in Kerning City, Ryden was pleased and explained that
            the entire
            city was now aware of the Dual Blades.

            He then ordered the Dual Blade to recover special seals which had been placed in the monsters of Kerning
            City,
            which had
            been making them behave abnormally, thus erasing all traces of the Dual Blades, after which he asked them to
            leave the
            city and await further orders. After the panic in the city died down, Ryden contacted the Dual Blade and
            told
            them that
            they were to meet with Lady Syl herself.

            Ryden led the Dual Blade into the Secret Garden, their organization's headquarters, where they first met
            with
            Shiba, who
            - according to rumors - could destroy anything that he touched. Shiba told the Dual Blade that Lady Syl
            believed that
            Jin - the current Dark Lord - had gained his position by assassinating her father, the former Dark Lord.

            The Dual Blade then spoke with Lady Syl's protégé, Yun, who explained that Jin and Syl had once been close
            during the
            time when Jin had served under her father. However, one day, the former Dark Lord had disappeared without a
            word, and
            Jin - after going in search of him - had returned with the Dark Lord's personal items and had reported that
            the Dark
            Lord had passed away, after which the people of Kerning City had made him the next Dark Lord. Syl had later
            been told by
            a passing Explorer that Jin had killed her father, after which she had vowed to get revenge.

            The Dual Blade then spoke with Lady Syl, who agreed to teach them the art of dual wielding if they could
            retrieve a
            Mirror of Insight, which would only reveal itself to those who were worthy of learning the way of the Dual
            Blade. After
            being chosen by the mirror, the Dual Blade was officially promoted to an official Dual Blade by Syl, who
            sent
            them to
            her pet own, Suri, for training.

            Soon after they finished training, Shiba contacted the Dual Blade and told them that Lady Syl's
            investigations
            had
            revealed an eye-witness to Jin's crime. The Dual Blade spoke with Mr. Pickall, who revealed that the former
            Dark Lord
            had been good friends with the late legendary hero, Tristan, who had once come to Kerning City in order to
            speak with
            him. Mr. Pickall suggested that they visit Manji in Perion, who had been a close friend of Tristan.

            In Perion, Manji agreed to share what he knew, though he warned that he wasn't sure about all the details.
            He
            revealed
            that he and Tristan had been heading to the Cursed Temple in order to seal Balrog, who had been resurrected.
            Knowing how
            important their mission was, they had asked the former Dark Lord to join them.

            Though they had been meant to convene before facing Balrog together, Tristan and Manji had been delayed in
            the
            Burnt
            Lands because of the boars. Upon arriving at the temple, however, they had found the Dark Lord dead and a
            boy,
            who was
            covered in blood, holding a sword and standing beside the body. The boy had merely given his name, Jin,
            before
            leaving
            with the Dark Lord's body. He then explained that he and Tristan had gone on to seal Balrog, and that
            Tristan
            had gained
            his legendary reputation for having sacrificed his life to do so.

            The Dual Blade reported back to Lady Syl, who became convinced that Jin had murdered her father. Several
            days
            later, she
            called the Dual Blade back to the Secret Garden, where she explained that ever since she had heard Manji's
            story, she
            hadn't been able to sleep well, as she had been consumed with thoughts of starting an all-out war with the
            Dark Lord and
            making him shed tears of repentance.

            She then tasked the Dual Blade with securing her father's diary, his last possession, hidden in a secret
            room
            inside the
            Jazz Bar. The Dual Blade infiltrated the room and fought several thief recruits who discovered them before
            returning
            back to Lady Syl with the diary. Syl explained that her father would often write in a cipher that only she
            could
            understand.

            Upon reading the last chapter, however, she grew furious to see that Jin had written in her father's diary
            and
            immediately threw it on the ground. The Dual Blade then picked up the diary and read Jin's words on the last
            pages. They
            learned that he had followed the former Dark Lord to the Cursed Temple after Syl had seemed worried about
            his
            sudden
            disappearance three days ago.

            Inside the temple, he had encountered an evil red-eyed monster that he had defeated in a fierce battle,
            after
            which he
            had been shocked to find that the monster had transformed back into the Dark Lord. The dying Dark Lord had
            revealed to
            him that his soul had been trapped within Balrog, and that Jin had freed him. He had then asked Jin to take
            care of Syl
            and Kerning City, and to never reveal what had happened to anyone, as he couldn't forgive himself for
            allowing
            Balrog to
            steal his soul. As the former Dark Lord had wished, Jin had decided to seal the diary away, and to never
            speak
            of that
            day.

            Several days later, Yun told the Dual Blade that ever since Lady Syl had read the diary, she had sequestered
            herself in
            her room and was refusing to eat or come out. She explained that since Syl had been close with Jin, she had
            long been
            confused about Jin being the target of her wrath, and that she was facing a crisis about the fact that her
            vendetta
            against him had been based on a lie.

            As Yun was worried that Syl would lose her will to keep living, she asked the Dual Blade to help give Syl a
            gift of
            Yellow Tulips from the Fire Boars. Soon after, Lady Syl called the Dual Blade and told them that she had
            been
            thinking a
            lot about the Dual Blades, and though she wasn't ready to meet with Jin yet, she knew that she had been
            neglecting her
            duties as the leader of the Dual Blades. She acknowledged that she had kept the Dual Blades in the shadows
            for
            so many
            years, and that it was now time for them to come out.

            Syl sent the Dual Blade to speak with Arec - the thief instructor at the Chief's Residence in El Nath - as
            her
            representative. Arec sensed a kinship with the Dual Blade and recognized them as a member of the Dual
            Blades,
            a
            different branch of thieves born out of hate. In order to officially recognize the Dual Blades, Arec had the
            Dual Blade
            acknowledge that their hatred had been born out of a misunderstanding. He also had them, the organization's
            representative, apologize on behalf of the Dual Blades for their actions. He then had the Dual Blade defeat
            the White
            Fangs, who were hurting the people of El Nath, after which he gave them a letter to pass along to Lady Syl,
            acknowledging their official existence.</p>

          <h3>Birth of an Alliance</h3>
          <p>Lady Syl called the Dual Blade and told them that she had come to a decision regarding the future of the
            Dual
            Blades.
            She explained that the Dual Blades would join the Maple Alliance under their own distinction, separate from
            thieves, in
            order to earn fear and respect through their reputation, as the Dual Blades outnumbered the combined forces
            of
            all the
            other Explorers on Victoria Island. She also hoped to obtain a sovereign domain in Victoria Island at the
            end
            of the war
            with the Black Mage.

            After having Syl's proposal accepted by Jin, the Dual Blade worked with Dances with Balrog, who convinced
            the
            Alliance
            to accept Lady Syl's terms. Despite the Alliance accepting the Dual Blades, the Cygnus Knights had voted
            against
            allowing them to join, with the Knights even sending spies to monitor the Dual Blades. Lady Syl then sent
            the
            Dual Blade
            to threaten Neinheart to stand down, after which they reached an agreement.</p>
