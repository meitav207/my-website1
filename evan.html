            <p><b>Evan</b> is one of the six Heroes. He is one of the two Heroes who is a Magician, the other being
              Luminous. Evan
              starts his journey on a farm as the son of a farmer. As the Dragon Master, he uses a dragon to fight
              alongside
              of his
              primary weapon, which is either a Wand or a Staff, while Documents or Shields are used as a secondary

              Raised as the son of a pig farmer, Evan stumbled across the last egg of the legendary Onyx Dragons,

          <h2>Story</h2>
          <h3>The Six Heroes</h3>
          <p>Centuries ago, there lived a powerful magician named Freud. Mighty even by the standards of Maple World, he
            delved into
            many different areas of magical research, but the highest among his interests was the study of the Onyx
            Dragons. His
            greatest desire was to find a way for humans and dragons to live together in peace. After many years of
            study
            and
            exploration, this desire would bring him before the greatest of Onyx Dragons, the Dragon King, Afrien.

            The King of the Onyx Dragons, Afrien was the greatest of his kind. Despite their many differences, Afrien
            loved humans
            as he loved all life. When Freud appeared before him, he found a kindred spirit, a human who shared his
            philosophical
            love for all lifeforms.

            Not wishing to miss out on this opportunity, Magician and Dragon pledged to each other a Spirit Pact of
            mutual
            defense
            and understanding. They bound themselves together using many powerful rituals and spells, creating the first
            Spirit
            Pact, the forerunner of the many that would come later. Under the pact, their two spirits would become one
            and
            the
            resulting bond would be unbreakable, even lasting past death.

            The benefits of the Spirit Pact were many and powerful. Magician and Dragon nurtured each other, each
            becoming
            stronger
            together than they ever could have alone. Together they ushered in an era of peace and justice, shining all
            the more
            brightly for the brief length of time that it lasted. It was shattered when a great evil entered Maple World
            -
            the Black
            Mage. When the Black Mage discovered the incredible power of the Onyx Dragons, he coveted it for himself.
            One
            night
            while Freud was away, the Black Mage granted himself an audience with the great Onyx Dragon King.

            Unable to understand the source of the Onyx Dragon's great power, the Black Mage asked Afrien to join him
            and
            betray
            Freud and the humans he had in his care. He promised the King that by working together they could become
            more
            powerful
            than anyone could imagine.

            Afrien tried to explain that the source of the Onyx Dragon's power was the love and trust that came from the
            Spirit
            Pact. He was incapable of betraying his friend, nor would he have broken the pact even if he was capable of
            it.
            Infuriated, the Black Mage vowed that if the Onyx Dragon would not join him, he would be destroyed. He
            sieged
            Leafre,
            the home of the Onyx, and wiped out all the Onyx Dragons, except for a single egg that Afrien protected.

            During the final battle, Freud and the other Heroes managed to seal the Black Mage, but at a great cost. The
            Black Mage
            cast a final curse at the Heroes, encasing them in ice. But unexpectedly, Afrien used the power of the
            Spirit
            Pact to
            take Freud's share of the curse. After the battle, Freud took Afrien to a remote island near Rien, where
            Afrien fell
            into a deep slumber as the cursed ice grew around him. Freud spent the remainder of his life trying to help
            the people
            of Maple World rebuild, and hid the last Onyx Dragon egg so that his successor could find it and create a
            new
            Spirit
            Pact.</p>

        <div class="main_story">
          <h2>Main Story</h2>
          <h3>The Spirit Pact</h3>
          <p>Centuries later, a young boy named Evan had a dream in which he met a large Onyx Dragon, who told him that
            he
            had been
            destined to become a Dragon Master. Upon awakening, Evan saw that the symbol on the dragon's forehead had
            been
            imprinted
            on the back of his hand. After completing some chores around the farm, Evan was sent by his father to find a
            lost
            piglet.

            As he approached it, he accidentally fell down a large covered hole in the ground and found himself in a
            forest exactly
            like the one from his dream. Instead of finding a dragon, however, he found an egg. Taking the egg, Evan
            climbed out of
            the hole and took the piglet back to his father. He then obtained an incubator from his brother Utah and
            placed the egg
            inside it. Soon after, the egg hatched and a baby dragon emerged from it. The dragon introduced himself as
            Mir
            and
            explained that their souls were now bound together by the Spirit Pact.

            With Mir's help, Evan learned that he was able to use magic, allowing him to quickly complete his other
            chores. After
            feeding Mir, Evan was sent by his father into town to deliver a letter to Chief Stan. Stan read the letter,
            which
            explained that there was a shortage of pig meat. Offering to help, Evan was sent by Stan to hunt Orange
            Mushroom Caps.

            Mir believed that helping people had to be the Dragon Master's calling and urged Evan to find other people
            in
            trouble.
            Evan went to Rina's house and met with Rina, who needed Blue Mushroom Caps for a Blue Mushroom Porridge that
            she wanted
            to make for her sick friend, Maya. However, she warned Evan not to go near the monsters, as they were much
            more
            dangerous than Orange Mushrooms. At Mir's insistence, however, Evan went anyways and brought the caps for
            Rina
            to make
            the porridge.

            Soon after, Chief Stan contacted Evan and explained that he needed help with something, but he first wanted
            to
            test
            Evan's strength before he entrusted him with the mission. He then asked Evan to bring back a puppet from the
            Crying Blue
            Mushrooms. After proving himself, Stan asked Evan to investigate the Golem Temple, as the Golems had become
            increasingly
            restless. At the Golem Temple, Evan found a mysterious building with a puppet hanging from it. He reported
            his
            discovery
            to Stan, who noted that the town could handle weaker monsters such as Pigs or Mushrooms, but Golems would be
            extremely
            dangerous.</p>

          <h3>Local Hero</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Stan contacted Evan and told him that Camila, Utah's girlfriend, had been kidnapped by the
            Golems
            while she
            had been out picking strawberries. Evan rushed to the temple and quickly defeated the Enraged Golem who had
            taken her.
            After bringing Camila back to town, Stan expressed his gratitude. Wondering about the cause of the Golems'
            behavior,
            Stan asked Evan to speak with Camila about anything strange that she might have noticed. Camila told him
            that
            she had
            seen Enraged Golems coming out of the same mysterious building that Evan had discovered. Stan then asked
            Evan
            to go into
            the building and eliminate the Enraged Golems to see if they had any clues. After doing so, Evan brought
            back
            a Golem
            puppet, confirming Stan's suspicions.

            As a final favor, Stan asked Evan to warn the other towns of Victoria Island. He asked Evan to go see Bruce,
            an
            archeologist who had been sent to study the Golems' behavior, in order to have him explain the details to
            the
            other
            towns. Bruce told Evan that he couldn't possibly go to every town on Victoria Island, and instead suggested
            that Evan
            ask Luke, a member of the Victoria Guard, as he could spread the word more easily. Bruce also suggested that
            it would be
            helpful if Evan brought evidence, and so Evan found a Golem puppet and took it to Luke. Though Luke was
            doubtful that a
            puppet could cause something so major, he nevertheless accepted Bruce's word as a professional and agreed to
            warn the
            other towns.

            At Luke's request, Evan traveled to Perion to warn Ayan, a resident of the town, about the monsters. Ayan
            then
            asked
            Evan to accept a position with the Victoria Guard and help around the town. After consulting with Mir, he
            accepted the
            position and was made into an honorary guard, as he was too young to be an official one. For his first
            mission, Evan was
            asked to find an Explorer who had gone missing in northern Perion. He found the missing Explorer,
            Christopher,
            who was
            severely dehydrated. Evan brought him Cold Stump Sap in order to help quench his thirst.

            He then reported back to Ayan, who asked him to update the warning signs around Perion to ensure they were
            up
            to date
            with correct information. After fixing the signs, Evan learned from Ayan that Smirking Ghost Stumps had been
            discovered,
            just as Evan had warned, and asked him to see if they had a puppet in them as well. Evan successfully
            returned
            with a
            puppet and, realizing the magnitude of the situation, Ayan decided to call in official Victoria Guard
            members
            to defend
            the town. Though Evan was no longer needed, she told him that because of his actions, he had grown more
            famous. She also
            told him that others around Victoria Island would benefit from his help as well.</p>

          <h3>Studying Onyx Dragons</h3>
          <p>As Evan continued his adventures, Mir went through a metamorphosis and grew larger as Evan became stronger.
            Realizing
            that he knew very little about dragons, Evan decided to research more about Mir's species. They went to
            Henesys to find
            Jay, Chief Stan's son, and asked him if he had any books on dragons. Jay told him that he did, though he
            only
            allowed
            Evan read it at the house, as he had been meaning to read it himself. Evan read that Mir's species was part
            of
            a
            category called Special Dragons, but details about Special Dragons were in the next volume of the book. Jay
            suggested
            that they visit the Magic Library in Ellinia in order to find the next volume. There, Grendel the Really Old
            told them
            that the book had already been checked out.

            After a long search, Evan finally tracked down the owner and obtained the book. He then discovered that Mir
            was a type
            of Special Dragon called an Onyx Dragon, whose souls were completed after forming Spirit Pacts with humans
            who
            possessed
            a soul of the same frequency. However, he also discovered that Onyx Dragons were said to be extinct.
            Refusing
            to believe
            that he was the last of his kind, Mir insisted that they do more research. Evan asked Grendel about Onyx
            Dragons, who
            told them that his friend, Chief Tatamo of Leafre, was a Halflinger, a race of dragon experts, and promised
            to
            ask him
            more about Onyx Dragons.

            Soon after, Grendel summoned Evan and Mir to the Magic Library. He told them that Chief Tatamo had gotten
            back
            to him
            and confirmed that he had information on the Onyx Dragons. However, he explained that Tatamo hardly talked
            about the
            Onyx Dragons, even to him, as though there was something about the topic that Tatamo felt guilty about.

            When Evan asked if there was any way to convince Tatamo to share what he knew, Grendel told him that Tatamo
            might help
            if Evan were to give him an Onyx Dragon scale. Evan asked Mir for a scale, but Mir refused and told him that
            it would
            create a bald spot on his hide. After Evan persuaded him with shrimp and fish from Gold Beach, Mir
            reluctantly
            allowed
            Evan to pluck a scale.[3] Evan brought the scale to Grendel, who told them that he would let them know what
            Tatamo said.

            Soon after, Evan and Mir were contacted by Grendel, who told them that Tatamo was very curious about how
            Evan
            had
            managed to obtain an Onyx Dragon's scale and wanted to meet him. Grendel offered to teleport them to Leafre,
            though he
            warned them not to roam outside the town, as the monsters in Leafre were far stronger than they could
            handle.

            At the Halflinger village, Tatamo was both amazed and relieved that an Onyx Dragon still lived, and a young
            one at that.
            When Evan asked how the Onyx Dragons had gone extinct, Tatamo merely told him that a dark force had wiped
            them
            out
            centuries ago, though he claimed that he had no idea why. He offered to let Mir stay in Leafre, where he
            would
            be cared
            for by the Halflingers, but Evan and Mir both refused and told him that they belonged at each other's side.
            Tatamo
            laughed and said that he understood, adding that Mir's existence made him all the more determined to find
            another Onyx
            Dragon. After leaving Leafre, Mir told Evan that he felt sad thinking that he was the last of his species.
            However, he
            reassured Evan that he still had hope that other Onyx Dragons still existed.</p>

          <h3>The Puppet Thief</h3>
          <p>Soon after returning to Victoria Island, Evan and Mir were contacted by Sabitrama, a shaman from
            Sleepywood.
            Sabitrama
            had heard stories about Evan's heroic actions around Victoria Island and wanted to request the young Dragon
            Master's
            help. He explained that someone had stolen his bag of herbs, which he used to make medicine, and suspected
            that the
            culprit was a thief from Kerning City. Evan went to Kerning City to investigate, where he ran into Alex,
            Chief
            Stan's
            runaway son. Alex asked Evan about the latest news from Henesys ever since he had run away in exchange for a
            tip to seek
            out JM From tha Streetz, who knew everything in Kerning City.

            JM demanded a fee of Stirge Wings for information, after which he told Evan that it was unlikely that anyone
            from the
            city had taken the herbs, as potions were much more convenient in modern day. Because of this, JM suspected
            that the
            thief had taken the herbs in order to use them rather than to sell them. He told them to speak with Nella,
            whose keen
            sense of smell might help them find the herbs. Evan explained the situation to Nella, who was offended by
            Sabitrama's
            belief that the thieves of Kerning City were criminals, explaining that the thieves of Kerning City merely
            adopted a
            particular aesthetic, and that they had no interest in taking other people's livelihoods. She swore to Evan
            that the
            thief wasn't from Kerning City and resolved to find them herself in order to restore Kerning City's honor.

            Nella soon contacted Evan and told him that she had sent her men to gather information on the thief, and
            that
            one of
            them had found a clue in Sleepywood. However, he had been attacked by Wraiths on the way back to Kerning
            City
            and had
            lost his report. Evan and Mir recovered the report in the Kerning City subway and brought it to Nella. She
            explained
            that the report was written in a secret code that only thieves used. After translating it, she learned that
            the thief
            had gone to a cave at the end of the forest in Ellinia.

            Inside the cave, they found a lone puppet, who explained that his master had been injured while fighting his
            enemies.
            Since the puppet had no money to buy potions, he had stolen the bag of herbs in order to heal his master. As
            his
            master's wounds still hadn't fully healed, he begged them to bring him some potions in order to help his
            master. After
            bringing him the potions, the puppet thanked them and returned the bag of herbs. Evan returned them to
            Sabitrama and
            told him how Nella had aided him in recovering the herbs. Sabitrama felt ashamed for his prejudice against
            Kerning City
            and asked Evan to apologize to Nella on his behalf. After Evan passed on Sabitrama's message, Nella was
            pleased that
            Kerning City's honor had been restored.</p>

          <h3>Joining the Secret Organization</h3>
          <p>Soon after, the puppet contacted Evan and told him that his master had agreed to let Evan join, provided
            that
            he pass
            the entry test, which was to eliminate Ligators in the Swamp Region, as they were disrupting his master's
            construction
            of a new base. After passing the entry test, Evan was told that there was yet another condition to join,
            which
            was to
            collect Croco Skins. After Evan brought him the skins, the puppet told Evan to expect to hear from him soon.

            Sure enough, the puppet soon told Evan that he had been accepted as a temporary member of the organization,
            though he
            added that Evan might soon be promoted to an official member after some time. He told Evan and Mir to go to
            the
            sixteenth floor of Orbis Tower, where they would find the details of their first mission behind a secret
            brick. He told
            Evan that upon becoming an official member, he would be able to meet directly with other members and choose
            which
            missions he wanted to accept.

            The puppet then transported them to Orbis Tower, where Evan found a badge for the secret organization, as
            well
            as
            instructions to collect Rapid Growth Accelerants from the Muddy Swamp Monsters in Kerning City.[4] Evan was
            also told to
            keep the instructions and the Accelerants behind the secret brick. After completing the mission, Mir
            wondered
            what the
            Accelerants would be used for, to which Evan suggested that they might be used to make crops grow faster.
          </p>

          <h3>The Second Mission</h3>
          <p>Evan and Mir were soon contacted by Hiver, who told them that he was the one who had given them their first
            mission.
            Evan asked if he was the owner of the puppet, but Hiver told them that its owner was Francis, whom he
            outranked. He also
            congratulated Evan and told him that the Rapid Growth Accelerant had been a big help to their organization,
            adding that
            even though Evan was not yet an official member, he had gone up in the ranks enough to be ready for his next
            mission.

            He told Evan to go to the Forest of the Dead in El Nath, where he was to defeat the Decaying Coolie Zombies
            and take
            their Decaying Zombie Molars, after which he was to take the molars and go to the Chief's Residence basement
            and
            exchange them with a goblin named Shammos. Though Evan and Mir had a bad feeling, they nevertheless
            completed
            their
            mission and gave the teeth to Shammos, who gave them a black key in return.

            Hiver then told Evan to put the key inside a small stump on the outskirts of town, explaining that another
            member of the
            organization would come pick it up. Mir was excited about having completed yet another mission and asked
            Evan
            if he felt
            as though they had done something good for the people of Maple World.

            Though he was confused about the purpose of the mission, Evan agreed that defeating the zombies must mean
            that
            they had
            done some good. Mir then wondered why the organization was so clandestine, as no one would know about their
            good deeds
            if the organization was secret. Evan supposed that it wouldn't be humble of them to brag about their good
            deeds.

            Soon after, Mir experienced another metamorphosis and grew even larger as Evan's magical mastery increased.
          </p>

          <h3>Dragon Riding</h3>
          <p>Grendel contacted Evan and asked how his research on Onyx Dragons was going. He had heard a rumor about
            someone on
            Victoria Island riding a dragon and wondered if Evan might be able to ride Mir. Mir told him that it was
            possible, but
            that Evan would need a saddle, as well as lessons on how to ride a dragon. Evan asked Grendel where the
            dragon
            rider
            could be found and learned that they were in Perion. There, they met the dragon rider FangBlade, who told
            them
            that he
            could teach Evan how to ride a dragon if he were to find a mount.[5] FangBlade suggested that they try
            checking Ereve,
            as many of the people there rode birds.

            In Ereve, Neinheart demanded that Evan state his name, job, and purpose, as Ereve was a restricted area.
            Evan
            was
            confused, as he had seen many people entering and leaving Ereve. Neinheart explained that they were Cygnus
            Knights and
            ordered Evan to leave immediately. Evan persistently asked how Ereve made their mounts, but Neinheart once
            again asked
            Evan for his name, job, and purpose.

            Evan introduced himself as a Dragon Master, which intrigued Neinheart enough that he resolved to look into
            what a Dragon
            Master was. He then told Evan that they outsourced production of saddles to Kenta in the Aquarium. With
            that,
            Neinheart
            insisted that they leave at once. They then went to speak with Kenta, who was intrigued by Mir. After taking
            his
            measurements, Kenta asked for Freezer Leather, a Seruf Pearl, and a service fee. After providing the items,
            Kenta made a
            saddle for Mir. They returned to Perion, where FangBlade taught Evan how to ride Mir.</p>

          <h3>The Mysterious Island</h3>
          <p>Grendel contacted Evan and told him that a new book had arrived in the Magic Library, which held a clue on
            the Onyx
            Dragons. When Evan arrived, Grendel showed him the book and explained that it was a voyage log written by
            John
            from Lith
            Harbor, which detailed his encounter with a dragon that had black scales and four golden horns while he had
            been
            marooned on an island covered in ice. Evan and Mir went to Lith Harbor in order to speak with John, who gave
            them a map
            to the island and told them to ask Teo to ferry them.

            Teo told them that the route to the island was especially perilous, and that he didn't have the skills to
            take
            them.
            However, he mentioned that Olaf, an experienced sailor, would be able to help them and suggested that they
            buy
            him a
            drink in order to persuade him. Evan bought Olaf his favorite drink, a Tropical Fruit Punch, and Olaf agreed
            to take
            them, although he explained that due to the harsh conditions on the voyage, he would need a stronger ship.
            He
            asked Evan
            to bring Wooden Boards and Slates from the monsters at the Excavation Site in Perion in order to fortify the
            ship, after
            which he told Evan that he would reach out once it was ready.

            Soon after, Olaf let Evan know that he had finished fortifying the ship. Evan and Mir climbed aboard and,
            after a long
            voyage, they finally arrived on the island. Mir was amazed at how quiet the island was, as the only noise
            came
            from the
            gently crashing waves. Directly in front of them was a large cave, inside which they found a large magical
            ice
            wall that
            separated them from what appeared to be a large Onyx Dragon. As they didn't want to accidentally hurt the
            dragon, Evan
            decided to leave the ice wall alone and resolved to return after thinking of another way to get inside.</p>

          <h3>The Third Mission</h3>
          <p>Evan was contacted by Hiver, who began explaining his third mission. Evan interrupted him and asked to
            learn
            more about
            the organization, as he knew nothing about it, despite being a member. Hiver told Evan to come to the Frog
            House in
            Ludibrium, where he introduced himself as Hiver, a top leader of the Black Wings. He explained that the
            Black
            Wings did
            many things to help Maple World, but their primary goal was to bring back the ‘great' Black Mage.

            Though he couldn't elaborate too much, he told Evan that the Black Wings had been created to revive the
            Black
            Mage, and
            that his return would be the greatest thing that could happen to Maple World. With that, he gave Evan his
            third mission,
            which was to capture the ghosts of Secret Master Soul Teddies. While collecting them, Mir asked Evan if he
            had
            felt that
            something was off, as rumors stated that the Black Wings were the same organization hated by the people of
            Edelstein.
            Mir felt that he wasn't sure whether they were on the right side or not. After returning to Hiver, Evan
            began
            to voice
            his concerns, but Hiver quickly dismissed him and said that he needed to focus on preparing the ghosts that
            Evan had
            collected.

            Soon, Hiver contacted Evan and told him that his preparations were complete. He gave Evan and Mir a pouch
            containing the
            spirits that they had captured and told them to use a special portal that he had created, which would take
            them to the
            Sky Terrace. There, Evan was to climb up a ladder and release the Master Soul Teddy spirits in order to
            chase
            everyone
            away. Evan and Mir followed his instructions and released the spirits, causing the guard who was patrolling
            the area to
            run away in fear.

            Evan was confused about why he had been told to do this, and after returning back to Frog House, he
            attempted
            to
            question Hiver. However, Hiver interrupted him once again and promised to answer his questions after the
            mission was
            complete. He told Evan that thanks to his actions, a member of the Black Wings had been able to break
            through
            the first
            layer of security at the Sky Terrace. He then asked Evan to go further inside and defeat a monster called
            the
            Door
            Block. Evan and Mir returned to the Sky Terrace and encountered the Door Block, who called them thieves and
            denounced
            their audacity in trying to steal the Seal Stone of Ludibrium.

            After defeating the Door Block, they returned to Hiver, who thanked them for their work and told them to get
            some rest,
            promising to contact them with their next mission soon. He then disappeared without having answered any of
            Evan's
            questions. Evan and Mir agreed that there was something strange about the Black Wings, as things weren't
            adding up about
            the missions that they had been completing.</p>

          <h3>The Fourth Mission</h3>
          <p>For their fourth mission, Hiver told them to obtain a map from Captain Hwang in Herb Town. He told them to
            ask the
            captain for a map of Turtle Island, as he would know what they meant. In Herb Town, Captain Hwang agreed to
            give them
            the map in exchange for defeating the pirates who had been harassing the people of Herb Town. After Evan and
            Mir
            eliminated the pirates, the captain gave them the map, but warned them that the journey to the island was
            perilous and
            recommended that they don't go. Evan then contacted Hiver to report their success. Hiver was impressed and
            teleported
            them to Frog House, where he told them that he had a fifth mission ready.</p>

          <h3>The Final Mission</h3>
          <p>With the map, Hiver modified the special portal that had taken them to the Sky Terrace and explained that
            they could use
            the portal to get to Turtle Island. He then gave Evan a Gruesome Bone that reeked of dark energy and told
            him
            to place
            it on an altar inside the cave that they would find, after which they were to leave immediately, no matter
            what else
            they found. He explained that an evil being had placed a spell on the island that prevented the Black Wings
            from
            entering, which was why he needed Evan's help. Evan reluctantly agreed and took the portal to Turtle Island.

            Upon arriving, he and Mir immediately realized that Turtle Island was the same island that they had sailed
            to
            with Olaf.
            They entered the cave and placed the bone upon the altar, causing its dark energies to melt the ice wall
            between them
            and the Onyx Dragon. Hiver was pleased and told them to head outside, where a boat was waiting for them.
            Evan
            attempted
            to tell Hiver about the Onyx Dragon, but Hiver told him to ignore it and escape before the dragon awoke.

            As they left the cave, Mir became increasingly frantic and told Evan that something was terribly wrong about
            the whole
            situation. Evan agreed with Mir and they decided to return to the cave, where they found Hiver and several
            Black Wings
            henchmen attempting to kill the dragon. Evan and Mir quickly defeated the henchmen and knocked back Hiver,
            who
            was
            impressed by their strength. He decided to retreat, but warned that they would be enemies once their paths
            crossed
            again.</p>

          <h3>The Onyx King</h3>
          <p>The sleeping dragon then awoke and telepathically spoke to Evan, introducing himself as Afrien, the King of
            Onyx
            Dragons. Evan asked him why the Onyx Dragons had gone extinct and why Afrien was trapped inside the ice
            cave.
            Afrien
            told Evan the story of how he and Freud had formed the Spirit Pact, and how the Black Mage had destroyed the
            Onyx
            Dragons. To elaborate, he showed Evan a memory of himself speaking with Freud shortly before they had
            stormed
            the Temple
            of Time. Evan witnessed how Afrien had asked Freud to take care of his egg if he were to fall in battle, and
            how, in
            turn, Freud had Afrien promise that he would do everything in his power to survive, as well as promising not
            to
            sacrifice himself on Freud's behalf.

            Evan then realized that Mir was Afrien's child, though Afrien asked Evan not to tell Mir, explaining that he
            was as good
            as dead, and that the knowledge would only bring Mir pain. He told Evan that when the Black Mage had cast
            his
            curse on
            the Heroes, he had taken the curse in Freud's place. He explained that the ice around his body had nearly
            melted, but
            that his body had become one with the island. Because of this, the animals who lived there would die if he
            were to move.
            Freud had cast a spell on the island to prevent anyone affiliated with the Black Mage from entering, and
            made
            it so that
            only a Dragon Master could awaken Afrien.

            Evan asked how Hiver knew all this, to which Afrien replied that it wasn't important. He then added that the
            important
            thing was that Hiver had used Evan. He explained that since Hiver couldn't enter the island himself, he had
            manipulated
            Evan into breaking the spell and awakening Afrien. He then told Evan that his only wish was that Evan and
            Mir
            stop the
            Black Wings. As Mir hadn't seen Afrien's memories, he asked Evan to tell him what he had learned. Evan kept
            his promise
            not to tell Mir about his ancestry and instead explained that the Black Mage, far from being the force of
            good
            that
            Hiver had promised, was the one responsible for wiping out the Onyx Dragons.</p>

          <h3>Unavoidable Truth</h3>
          <p>Realizing that they had been manipulated, Evan and Mir decided to visit each of the places they had
            completed
            missions
            in in order to see what consequences their actions had wrought. In Orbis, they learned from Lisa that the
            Rapid Growth
            Accelerant had caused much harm due to the Giant Nependeaths it created, and that only the actions of a
            passing traveler
            had resolved the situation.

            Next, they went to the Chief's Residence in El Nath, where they spoke with the Magician Instructor Robeira.
            Evan asked
            if they had done good work by hunting the zombies, to which she responded that they had indeed. She told
            them
            that if it
            hadn't been for the zombies, El Nath could have developed further such that they would have the resources to
            find a way
            to get rid of them. However, she warned them to take care of any zombie teeth that they recovered, as the
            teeth
            contained a dark corruptive energy. She told them that the corruption had taken hold of Shammos, who
            continued
            to
            perform misdeeds in spite of wanting to atone for his wrongdoings.

            When Evan asked what Shammos had done wrong, Robeira explained that Shammos had been caught with a copy of
            the
            key to
            the basement of the Chief's Residence. Although she had taken it away, she believed that he had likely made
            more copies
            and explained that there was an old treasure stored in the basement, which needed to be protected at all
            costs.

            In Ludibrium, they spoke with a guard named Marcel, who told them that the Door Block had guarded an
            important
            treasure.
            Although no one knew what the treasure was, its theft had been a major incident in Ludibrium. After
            realizing
            just how
            badly their actions had inflicted misfortune on the people of Maple World, Evan and Mir were furious and
            decided to
            confront Hiver at Frog House in order to get revenge.

            There, Hiver told them that while they had been useful for a time, they had become nothing more than
            hindrances. Evan
            and Mir unleashed their full power, which overwhelmed Hiver enough that he retreated. Knowing that he had
            probably
            returned to the Black Wings base in Edelstein, Evan and Mir decided to follow him there.</p>

          <h3>Birth of an Alliance</h3>
          <p>Evan and Mir arrived in Edelstein in order to get revenge on Hiver. Mir suggested storming the Verne Mine
            and
            attacking
            all the Black Wings inside, but Evan told him that he didn't want to attack random people just because they
            worked for
            the Black Wings, reminding Mir that they themselves used to be part of the Black Wings until recently.[6]

            They decided to go undercover in order to learn Hiver's location and asked a watchman named Bavan where
            Hiver
            was by
            making up a story that they owed him money. Bavan agreed to contact Hiver in exchange for Nependeath's Honey
            from Orbis.
            After bringing him the honey, Bavan told Evan that he had arranged for Evan to meet Hiver in the Verne Mine.

            Inside the mine, however, Black Wings henchmen ambushed them and Evan realized that Bavan and Hiver had set
            up
            a trap.
            After defeating the henchmen, a strange woman arrived and had a stand-off with Evan, though she quickly
            realized that he
            was a civilian and disappeared. Evan and Mir also realized that she was likely an enemy of the Black Wings
            and
            left to
            go confront Bavan.

            In town, however, they recognized Claudine as the same woman from the mine. After confronting her, she told
            them to meet
            her in Edelstein Park if they wanted to question her. There, they both realized that they were on the same
            side, and so
            Evan asked if he and Mir could team up with her. However, Claudine told them that she couldn't trust them
            yet,
            as they
            might be a spy or might be too weak.

            In order to have them prove themselves, she told them to take the secret route to Gelimer's laboratory and
            bring back
            Black Wings emblems from his henchmen. After they brought the emblems back, Claudine told them that even
            though they
            might have gotten them from their commanders, she felt as though she could trust them, not only because of
            their
            actions, but also because of the intelligence that the Resistance had stolen from the Black Wings, which
            detailed their
            dealings with the Onyx Dragons. She told them about the upcoming Continental Conference and asked if they
            wanted to
            accompany her, to which Evan and Mir happily agreed.

            After receiving unanimous confirmations, the First Continental Conference took place and the Maple Alliance
            was
            officially created.</p>

          <h3>Final Quest</h3>
          <p>Mir soon felt Evan's soul growing stronger and resonating with his own. Through the power of the Spirit
            Pact,
            they
            gained a new power that signified that they had become the true successors of Freud and Afrien.</p>
