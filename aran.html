          <h2>Story</h2>
          <h3>The Six Heroes</h3>
          <p>Aran was a powerful warrior who possessed a polearm with a spirit, Maha, which she obtained from a
            legendary
            blacksmith
            in Mu Lung. As weapons with spirits were extremely rare, and even rarer still was it to be deemed worthy to
            wield one,
            it spoke immensely of Aran's strength as a legendary warrior. Having grown up with a stoic grandfather, Aran
            developed a
            quiet, serious personality. She also rode a powerful Silver Wolf named Ryko into battle.

            Aran was one of the many people who gathered at the Dragon Master's Tower, which was lit by Ryude and his
            band
            of
            soldiers in order to warn Maple World that the end of the world was approaching. She joined Freud and four
            others to
            become the Heroes of Maple who fought against the tyranny of the Black Mage.

            During the last days of the war, Aran and the other Heroes received a letter from the Demon, who planned to
            betray the
            Black Mage. Soon after, Arkarium arrived to battle the Heroes. Aran was injured in the fight and was left
            behind by the
            other Heroes to evacuate with Athena Pierce. Aran soon regained consciousness and helped Athena with the
            rest
            of the
            evacuation by rescuing a lost child in the burning forest, after which she rushed to meet up with the other
            Heroes at
            the Temple of Time.

            She single-handedly held off the Black Mage's ground forces while Freud, Afrien, Mercedes, Luminous, and the
            pirate hero
            went ahead to fight the Black Mage. The other Heroes were successful in sealing the Black Mage, though he
            managed to
            unleash a curse upon the Heroes before he was sealed. Aran and the other Heroes were expelled from the
            Temple
            of Time
            and fell back down to the burning forests of Leafre.

            Soon after, a member of the Silent Crusade, having traveled back centuries from the present, appeared and
            ran
            into an
            unconscious Aran. Maha explained that he was planning to transport Aran to the frozen island of Rien in
            order
            to slow
            down the Black Mage's curse. However, he had been damaged during the fight and lost much of his strength.
            After the
            Crusader helped repair Maha, the spirit used the last of his power to take his master to Rien, where she
            eventually
            succumbed to the Black Mage's curse and froze in ice.

            Over the centuries, a small clan who still remembered the legend of the Heroes held faith that the lost hero
            Aran, who
            remained frozen on the island, would one day awaken. Over the centuries, the Rien Clan continued passing
            down
            the
            prophecy of the Heroes' return, though many slowly began to lose faith.

            One by one, the clan began to leave Rien until only two siblings, Lilin and Neinheart von Rubistein,
            remained.
            Eventually, even Neinheart lost faith in the prophecy and decided that he would rather take fate into his
            own
            hands by
            finding the lost descendent of Empress Aria in order to have them become the next ruler of Maple World.
            Lilin
            and
            Neinheart got into an argument, and when Lilin refused to abandon her faith, Neinheart left her behind.</p>

          <h2>Main Story</h2>
          <h3>Awakening on Rien</h3>
          <p>On Rien, Aran finally awoke from the ice, where she found Lilin waiting for her. Aran discovered that she
            had
            no
            memories, which Lilin explained was the result of the Black Mage's curse. Lilin explained that the curse on
            Aran had
            caused the island of Rien to become permanently frozen, even though it hardly ever snowed naturally.

            She took Aran into town, where the penguins who lived there were amazed at the prophesized return of the
            hero.
            Lilin
            explained that her clan possessed a Book of Prophecy that foretold the Heroes' return, and that she was the
            last member
            of her clan still living on Rien. As Aran had lost her abilities from the curse, Lilin decided to help train
            Aran and
            return her to full strength, as the Black Mage was fated to return as well. After some basic training, Lilin
            showed Aran
            the giant polearm that they had excavated. Upon touching the polearm, some of Aran's old strength flowed
            into
            her.</p>

          <h3>Information Dealer's Request</h3>
          <p>
            As she had grown stronger than the monsters of Rien, Aran was advised by Lilin to go train in Victoria
            Island.
            She told
            Aran that an information broker named Mr. Truth, better known as Tru, could help her get stronger. Aran
            arrived at Lith
            Harbor and went to Tru's shop. After reading a letter of introduction from Lilin, Tru was amazed by Aran's
            return and
            explained that he was also part of the Rien Clan, although he had left long ago after losing faith in the
            Heroes'
            return. In order to validate Lilin's faith, he promised to help Aran in any way that he could.

            To help her get stronger, Tru suggested that she work as an informant for him, as it would help her get
            stronger and
            learn more about Maple World. He sent Aran on a test mission to get the latest news from the crewmen who
            worked in Lith
            Harbor. Aran questioned Teo, who offered to exchange the information for Snail Shells, which he believed
            could
            help ease
            his arthritis. After bringing him the shells, Teo told her that the crewmen were mainly talking about the
            formation of
            the Cygnus Knights, as well as some concerns that the Black Mage may soon be coming back.

            Tru then sent Aran on her first real mission, which was to investigate the recent behavior of Orange
            Mushrooms
            in
            Henesys. There, Aran spoke to a mushroom researcher named Scarrs, who asked her to defeat Cynical Orange
            Mushrooms for
            him. After defeating them, Aran returned and brought him an Orange Mushroom puppet, which she had found
            inside
            one of
            the monsters.

            Scarrs then asked her to defeat Berserk Horny Mushrooms in order to check if they had puppets inside them as
            well. Aran
            confirmed this by bringing him back a puppet from inside the monsters. Scarrs hypothesized that the puppets
            were
            responsible for the strange behavior of the monsters. To confirm his theory, he asked Aran to investigate
            Crying Blue
            Mushrooms, where Aran found yet another puppet. Scarrs told her that the puppets produced a noise on a
            frequency that
            only monsters could hear, and promised that he would research more on the nature of the puppets.

            Soon after, Tru asked Aran to visit him at his store, where he told her the news about the kidnapping
            incident
            in
            Henesys and asked her to learn more from Chief Stan. Stan told her about how an Enraged Golem had kidnapped
            Camila
            several days ago, and that it was likely due to a puppet. Aran went to the Golem Temple and found a Golem
            puppet in the
            monsters. Stan then asked her to question Camila about what she had seen.

            When Aran asked Camila if she had seen anyone suspicious near the Golem Temple, Camila replied that there
            were
            always
            Explorers around the temple, though there hadn't been anyone suspicious at the time. Aran then asked if she
            had seen
            anyone who could have been putting the puppets inside the monsters around town. Camila suddenly remembered
            that a
            strange boy had arrived holding a puppet a few days ago, which had also been around the time that strange
            activities had
            begun occurring in Henesys.

            Realizing that this boy was the cause of the puppet activity, Aran warned Chief Stan about him before
            returning to Tru.
            Tru thanked Aran for the information, but added that he was worried for the people of Henesys. He suggested
            that she
            return to help the townspeople in the meantime. Upon arriving, Chief Stan informed her that the strange boy
            had been
            sighted near the Golem Temple and asked her to check if the Golems had any strange puppets inside them. Aran
            investigated the temple and told Stan that she hadn't seen anything suspicious. Stan told her to stay on
            standby, and
            that he would contact her again if anything suspicious came up.
          </p>

          <h3>Traces of the Puppeteer</h3>
          <p>
            Chief Stan called Aran and told her that the strange boy had once again been sighted near the Golem Temple.
            Though Aran
            took down many more Golems, she was unable to find any traces of the strange boy. After reporting back to
            Stan, Aran
            heard a mysterious voice inviting her to his cave. Aran was teleported to the cave, where the strange boy
            introduced
            himself as Francis the Puppeteer from the Black Wings. He told Aran that she had annoyed him by getting rid
            of
            his
            puppets and threatened her with the wrath of the Black Mage if she didn't stay out of his way.

            Aran returned to Tru's shop and explained what had happened. Tru explained that he had heard of the Black
            Wings and told
            her that he had thought that they were merely a hoax. He began to grow concerned that the old prophecies
            were
            coming
            true, which would mean that the Black Mage was fated to return soon. He resolved to look into the Black
            Wings
            and told
            Aran to inform Lilin about this latest development, adding that the return of the Heroes, the followers of
            the
            Black
            Mage, and the prophecy were all connected. Given how much Lilin had researched and believed in the Heroes,
            Tru
            told Aran
            that Lilin had a right to know as much as anyone.

            Aran returned to Rien and explained the situation to Lilin. She replied that the Book of Prophecy stated
            that
            the Heroes
            would return and destroy the Black Mage for good, and that the rise of the Black Wings seemed to confirm
            that
            the Black
            Mage was still alive. When Aran asked if Lilin was afraid, she responded that she had no fears, as she was
            certain that
            Aran would defeat the Black Mage. She reassured Aran that it was clear that her strength was returning since
            coming out
            of the ice, and that there was no way that Aran had endured so much suffering only to lose to the Black
            Mage.

            Just then, Tru got back to Aran and asked her to investigate the Smirking Ghost Stumps in Perion, citing the
            similarities between their appearance and the events in Henesys, and suggested finding 10 Boogies for more
            details. Upon
            arriving, 10 Boogies told Aran that a puppet was the likely cause for the strange behavior, but after
            defeating the
            Smirking Ghost Stumps, Aran was unable to find any puppets inside them.

            10 Boogies then showed her a monitor that could detect puppet activity, which confirmed that there was a
            puppet in the
            area. She explained that if a puppet were inside a monster, the puppet energy on the monitor would have been
            moving, but
            the monitor indicated that the puppet energy was still. 10 Boogies suspected that the puppet was hidden in
            the
            area and
            asked Aran to investigate. Aran then discovered several puppets hidden beneath piles of old relics.

            With this information, 10 Boogies concluded that firstly, aberrant monster behavior always stemmed from a
            puppet;
            secondly, the puppets didn't have to be inside the monsters, merely in the area; finally, the Puppeteer had
            the power to
            control all of Victoria Island, not just a specific town. With her investigation complete, Aran reported
            back
            to Tru,
            who told her that he would look into the Puppeteer's activity in order to pinpoint his location. He also
            warned Aran
            that since she had disrupted the Puppeteer's plans several times, he might try to get revenge. 10 Boogies
            then
            contacted
            Aran and asked her to deliver her research report to Neinheart, as she was unable to leave her post. In
            Ereve,
            Neinheart
            thanked Aran for delivering the report, but curtly asked her to leave as soon as possible, as Ereve was
            closed
            to
            strangers.

            Some time later, Tru told Aran that Francis had been sighted in Ellinia and asked her to speak with Rowen
            the
            Fairy, who
            was the one who had seen him. Rowen told Aran that she had seen a robed boy earlier, and that she believed
            him
            to be the
            Puppeteer because the Evil Eyes had become much more violent shortly after his appearance. She asked Aran to
            defeat Evil
            Eyes to stop their noise pollution of the forest, after which she told Aran to go to the northern forests,
            where she
            would find a cave decorated with puppets.

            Aran went to the cave and heard a voice that demanded a password to enter. She returned to Rowan, who
            suggested that
            Fanzy, a magical cat who lived near the Great Tree, might have overheard the password. Fanzy offered to give
            Aran the
            password in exchange for Evil Eye tails. He then told her that the password was “******* is a genius
            Puppeteer!”,
            explaining that he hadn't caught the first word, though he added that it sounded like a name. Aran returned
            to
            see Tru,
            where they deduced that the missing word was ‘Francis'.

            With the password, Aran entered the cave and confronted Francis, who was shocked that Aran had managed to
            infiltrate his
            cave. Aran then proceeded to soundly defeat Francis, although he managed to escape. Aran then took a
            document
            from his
            cave and brought it to Tru. He realized that the document was written in code and told Aran to bring it to
            Lilin, who
            was a master codebreaker.

            Lilin solved the code and learned that Francis' mission was to recover the Seal Stone of Victoria Island,
            and
            that he
            had been using his puppets to control the monsters of Victoria Island in order to find it. The report also
            showed that
            due to unforeseen complications from external forces, the mission had been delayed and Francis had requested
            reinforcements. Lilin was unsure what the Seal Stone was, but as it seemed to be something that the Black
            Wings were
            searching desperately for, she believed that it had to be closely related to the Black Mage. Knowing that
            Aran
            was
            likely the external complication that Francis was referring to, Lilin advised Aran to exercise caution and
            to
            continue
            training.
          </p>

          <h3>Second Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Lilin called Aran back to Rien because of the strange behavior of her polearm. Aran returned to
            Rien and
            found the polearm vibrating, as well as a spirit floating next to it. The spirit told Aran that he had been
            trying to
            call her for some time and introduced himself as Maha, the spirit of her polearm. Having lost her memories,
            Aran was
            unable to recognize him and instead asked Lilin, who told her that the Heroes' weapons were said to have
            personalities
            of their own.

            In order to help Aran remember Maha, Lilin told her to visit the Mirror Cave and look into the Mirror of
            Desire, which
            had the power to show whatever the user desired. Through the mirror, Aran witnessed her past self going to
            Mu
            Lung in
            order to obtain the greatest weapon ever made by the Master Blacksmith. After completing a trial to prove
            her
            strength,
            the Blacksmith had presented her with his finest creation, Maha. Aran then returned to Maha and told him
            that
            she
            remembered him. Maha was overjoyed and explained that since her body had gone through intense training in
            the
            past, her
            powers could be jogged through muscle memory. He then used his powers to restore part of Aran's old
            strength.

          <h3>The Seal Stone of Victoria Island</h3>
          <p>Aran was contacted by Tru, who asked her to come see him at his shop, though Aran noted that Tru's
            mannerisms
            were
            uncharacteristic of him. She arrived at his shop and found him tied unconscious to a chair, with Francis and
            a
            second
            Tru awaiting her. Francis thanked the second Tru, who revealed himself to be a shapeshifted Baroq. After
            Baroq
            left,
            Francis told Aran that the reason she had beaten him last time was because he had just come back from a
            battle
            with the
            Cygnus Knights, promising that he would be a much stronger foe this time around.

            Despite his boasting, Aran was once again able to defeat him with ease, forcing Francis to retreat. She then
            freed Tru,
            who thanked her for saving him. He was surprised that Francis would have gone so far, but he was content
            with
            having
            learned the Puppetmaster's weaknesses. Aran was confused by what he meant, and so Tru explained that
            Francis'
            drastic
            measures meant that the document which she had obtained from his cave was real, which confirmed that the
            Black
            Wings'
            goal was to recover the Seal Stone of Victoria Island. He then urged Aran to keep training while he
            investigated
            further.

            Soon after, Tru learned that the cave in Ellinia was empty, meaning that Francis had changed his
            headquarters.
            After
            investigating, he found that Francis was hiding in the Golem Temple and sent Aran to deal with him. After
            defeating
            Francis, Aran returned to Tru, who asked her why she seemed downcast. Aran told him that her mission had
            been
            a failure,
            as she had failed to learn anything about the Seal Stone of Victoria Island in Francis' hideout.

            To her surprise, Tru revealed that he had already found it. As the Black Wings knew where his shop was, Tru
            felt that it
            would be unwise to keep the Seal Stone, and so he asked Aran to give it to Lilin for safekeeping, explaining
            that Rien
            was normally only populated by the native races of the island, and so many spells had been placed on it to
            keep it
            inaccessible to foreigners. He then told Aran that he would no longer assign her missions, as she had gained
            enough
            experience about Maple World to gather information for herself. He told her to keep investigating the Black
            Wings and
            asked her to let him know immediately if she learned more about the Seal Stone.</p>

          <h3>The Seal Stone of Orbis</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Tru contacted Aran and told her that he had expanded his intelligence network outside Victoria
            Island,
            allowing him to learn that something had happened in Orbis, which possibly involved the Black Wings. In
            Orbis,
            Aran
            spoke with a half-Nymph named Lisa, who told her that she had been unable to sleep last night because of a
            thumping
            noise that kept all the fairies in Orbis awake. After investigating the source, Lisa had learned that there
            were Giant
            Nependeaths growing in the Neglected Strolling Path. As Nependeaths didn't grow so abnormally large, she
            asked
            Aran to
            investigate the source of what was causing such a drastic growth.

            After defeating the Giant Nependeaths, Aran found bottles of Rapid Growth Accelerants. She brought them to
            Lisa, who
            told her that Orbis had been slowly sinking from the sky year by year, explaining that the heavier the mass
            on
            Orbis,
            the faster they would sink. She asked Aran to consult with a seer named Spiruna about whether Orbis was
            going
            to sink
            because of the Giant Nependeaths. Though she normally hated strangers, Spiruna sensed that Aran had a
            strange
            aura and
            allowed her to speak. Aran explained the situation with the Giant Nependeaths and asked whether they would
            cause Orbis
            to sink.

            Peering into the future, Spiruna foresaw that Orbis would be safe, though she asked Aran where the Giant
            Nependeaths had
            been growing. After learning that they had been growing in the Neglected Strolling Path, Spiruna wondered
            whether
            someone had been trying to get into the Sealed Garden. Aran began asking what the Sealed Garden was, but
            Spiruna snapped
            at her and asked who she was and why she was asking such questions. Before Aran could respond, Spiruna
            looked
            into her
            crystal ball and was shocked by what she saw. She told Aran that a great fate hung over her, which was to
            overcome a
            terrible curse that had persisted for countless centuries.

            Though she didn't know much about the Sealed Garden, Spiruna told Aran that the Empress had ordered it
            off-limits, as it
            was where the Seal Stone of Orbis was hidden.[4] Spiruna explained that the only way to get to the Sealed
            Garden was to
            make the Nependeaths in the Neglected Strolling Path grow large enough to reach the vines growing down from
            the Sealed
            Garden and asked Aran to stop the people trying to steal the Seal Stone.

            In the Sealed Garden, Aran encountered Dargoth the Giant of the Black Wings. Dargoth realized that Aran was
            the one who
            had defeated Francis and laughed that he would take the Seal Stone and defeat Aran all at once. Aran was
            able
            to defeat
            Dargoth, but Hiver took the Seal Stone and disappeared before Aran could stop him. Frustrated, Aran returned
            to Tru and
            told him what had happened in Orbis. Though Tru was disappointed that the Black Wings had stolen the Seal
            Stone of
            Orbis, he was intrigued to know that there were multiple Seal Stones.

            He told Aran to cheer up and let Lilin know about what had happened, reminding her about the importance of
            keeping Lilin
            in the loop. Lilin agreed with Tru that the confirmation of the existence of multiple Seal Stones was a
            major
            discovery
            and reminded Aran that their acquisition of the Seal Stone of Victoria Island was an even bigger success.
            She
            told Aran
            to keep focusing on her training while she and Tru kept looking into the locations of the Seal Stones.</p>

          <h3>The Wolf Pup</h3>
          <p>Some time later, Aran was summoned to Rien by a penguin named Pucci, who explained that while taking care
            of
            his
            huskies, he had realized that one of them was actually a wolf. As wolves weren't native to Rien, he wondered
            where it
            might have come from. Though he didn't know much about wolves, he felt that it would be cruel to abandon it,
            and so he
            had resolved to raise the wolf until it could take care of itself. In order to find out more about raising
            wolves, he
            asked Aran to go to Snowy Whale Island in Aqua Road in order to visit Nanuke, who was experienced in raising
            wolves.

            Nanuke told Aran that she had raised wolves before and offered to make a Wolf Pup Formula in order to help
            it
            grow
            stronger. For the formula, she asked Aran to bring Seahorse Tails and Wolf Cub Vitamins from Kenta in the
            Aquarium. Aran
            brought the ingredients to Nanuke, who made the formula for her. She took it to Rien and fed the wolf, who
            instantly
            grew attached to her. Pucci told her that he had named the wolf Werewolf, and that Aran would soon be able
            to
            ride it.

            Some time later, Aran encountered Scadur in El Nath, who was impressed to see Werewolf, as he hadn't seen
            anyone with a
            wolf in ages. He told her that he could teach her to ride the wolf and explained that she would need a Wolf
            Saddle. He
            offered to make her one in exchange for bringing Jr. Yeti Skins for the raw materials. With the skins,
            Scadur
            made her
            the saddle and taught her how to ride Werewolf.</p>

          <h3>The Seal Stone of Mu Lung</h3>
          <p>Back in Lith Harbor, Tru reached out to Aran and told her that he had learned of Black Wings activity in Mu
            Lung. He
            told her to investigate Mr. Do, who had been in contact with one of the Black Wings. Mr. Do told Aran that
            the
            Black
            Wings member was known as the Shadow Knight, and that the Shadow Knight had given him a Hanging Scroll to
            pass
            on to Mu
            Gong, the master of Mu Lung Dojo. However, Mr. Do had accidentally boiled the scroll while making medicine
            and
            the
            contents of the scroll had been lost. He asked Aran to visit Jin Jin, the best painter in Mu Lung, in order
            to
            see if he
            could restore it. Jin Jin had Aran gather ingredients to create a Special Ink, which he then used to restore
            the Hanging
            Scroll.

            Aran read the scroll and found out that it was a warning from the Shadow Knight that he was going to steal
            the
            Seal
            Stone of Mu Lung. She showed the scroll to Mr. Do, who realized that the Shadow Knight had written it as a
            challenge to
            Mu Gong and asked Aran to warn him. Though one would have to normally fight to the top floor of the dojo in
            order to
            reach Mu Gong, Mr. Do told her that Mu Gong's apprentice, So Gong, could be bribed into showing her the back
            route to Mu
            Gong. As So Gong was obsessed with becoming the strongest warrior, Mr. Do told Aran that if she brought him
            Bellflowers,
            which were said to be good for one's health, he might let her pass. Sure enough, when Aran brought the
            Bellflowers, So
            Gong showed her the secret path to reach his master.

            At the top of the dojo, Aran gave the Hanging Scroll to Mu Gong, who grew worried that the Shadow Knight
            would
            steal the
            Seal Stone. He told Aran that the Seal Stone was a valuable item guarded by the warriors of Mu Lung for
            centuries. When
            Aran asked for more details on the Seal Stone, Mu Gong tested her to see if she was worthy of receiving the
            knowledge.
            Aran successfully fought Mu Gong's shadow and Mu Gong immediately recognized her fighting style, which he
            said
            had been
            used centuries ago and was rumored to have even been used by one of the Heroes. Because of this, he mistook
            Aran to be a
            disciple of the Heroes, but nevertheless told her the location of the Seal Stone, as well as the password to
            enter.

            Though he knew that the Shadow Knight's challenge had been meant for him, he felt that it would be better
            for
            the hero's
            successor to face him. Aran then entered the Sealed Temple, where the Shadow Knight was waiting. Just like
            Mu
            Gong, he
            mistook her for the hero's successor rather than one of the Heroes herself. Aran was able to defeat the
            Shadow
            Knight,
            but just like in Orbis, the Gentleman appeared from the shadows and took the Seal Stone of Mu Lung.

            Frustrated, Aran returned to Mu Gong to report her failure. To Aran's surprise, Mu Gong revealed that the
            Heroes had
            entrusted the Seal Stone with the chief of Mu Lung, who had constructed the Sealed Temple in order to
            safeguard it. He
            then told Aran that the loss of the Seal Stone may not have been significant, as he had believed that the
            reason the
            Sealed Temple was so heavily protected was because it was the legacy of the Heroes, adding that he didn't
            know
            the
            purpose of the Seal Stone.

            Dejected, Aran returned to Tru and told him about the events in Mu Lung. Tru reassured Aran that she was
            growing
            stronger, and that she would stop the Black Wings next time. He told her to speak with Lilin about what she
            had learned
            in Mu Lung. Lilin was excited to learn that the Heroes had left behind the Seal Stones and said that the
            information
            made up for losing the Seal Stone. Aran was confused by how she had reached that conclusion, to which Lilin
            explained
            that by piecing together information on the Heroes, she could predict which places were likely to have the
            Seal Stones
            before the Black Wings found out. As always, she told Aran to focus on training while she researched the
            Heroes and Tru
            looked into the Black Wings.</p>

          <h3>Third Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>Lilin called Aran to Rien once again. She explained that Maha had been acting strangely and suspected that
            he
            wanted to
            speak with her. In Rien, Maha told Aran that a thief had stolen a Red Jade that decorated the polearm. He
            believed that
            the thief had disguised themselves as a penguin in order to avoid detection, and that they were likely
            fleeing
            Rien as
            he spoke. Aran chased after the thief, which she discovered was a Thief Crow, and managed to defeat it.
            However, she
            forgot to recover the Red Jade and returned back to town.

            As Maha succumbed to hysterics, Aran asked Lilin what to do, as the Thief Crow had likely recovered from the
            battle and
            escaped with the jewel. Lilin believed that the Red Jade likely amplified Maha's powers, and so they needed
            to
            quickly
            make a replacement. She suggested that Aran visit the Mirror of Desire once again in order to find out how
            to
            craft the
            jewel. Through the mirror, Aran saw one of her memories, in which she encountered a Yeti named Tititi in El
            Nath. Tititi
            was crying, as a Thief Crow had stolen his Red Jade. After Aran recovered the jewel, Tititi gave it to her
            as
            a reward.
            Through the mirror, the present-day Aran was able to extract the Red Jade from her memories and affixed it
            back on the
            polearm. Maha was overjoyed by the return of his jewel and, with his powers amplified once again, he was
            able
            to bestow
            more of Aran's old power upon her.</p>

          <h3>The Seal Stone of Ellin Forest</h3>
          <p>Tru contacted Aran and told her that a crack in time had appeared in the Time Control Room of Ludibrium,
            which
            was
            rumored to lead centuries into the past when the Heroes were still active. Aran entered through the crack in
            time and
            arrived in Ellin Forest. Proceeding deeper into the forest, she arrived at Altaire Camp and met Loha, who
            assumed that
            she was a lost refugee and sent her to Athena Pierce. At the Camp Conference Room, Aran met with Athena and
            began to
            explain who she was, but Athena remained unconvinced of her identity, as Aran looked different and she was
            unable to
            remember Athena.[5]

            Aran began explaining everything that had happened to her since awakening from the ice, and though Athena
            found it
            unbelievable, she could not deny that Aran's eyes and her manner of speaking suggested that she was telling
            the truth.
            Choosing to believe her, Athena introduced herself and told Aran about how the refugees of Leafre had
            crash-landed on
            Victoria Island and established Altaire Camp while searching for fertile lands in order to relocate to. She
            then asked
            Aran why she looked different, causing them both to realize that coming through the crack in time had likely
            changed her
            appearance.

            Athena then asked Aran whether she had come in search of her lost memories, but when Aran explained that she
            was looking
            for Seal Stones, Athena told her that she had been given a Seal Stone by the Heroes, which she was keeping
            locked in the
            library. After obtaining the storage key from Loha, Aran entered the library and encountered Hiver, who had
            also entered
            the crack of time. Before she could stop him, Hiver disappeared with the Seal Stone of Ellin Forest.

            Athena apologized to Aran for not having better secured the Seal Stone, but Aran reassured her that it
            wasn't
            her fault.
            Athena then told her that she had also been given a letter by Aran of the past, which she recalled had
            mentioned
            something about the Seal Stones. However, when Aran tried to take the letter, it merely fell through her
            hands, which
            Athena found strange, as Aran had been able to take the storage key from Loha without any problems.[6]

            Since she was an elf, and thus had a long lifespan, Athena suggested that she could keep the letter and
            instructed Aran
            to find her in the present day. After returning to her own time, Aran told Tru what had happened in Ellin
            Forest and
            asked him who Athena Pierce was. She was surprised to learn that Athena was one of the most famous people in
            Maple
            World, both as the instructor for bowmen and as an influential leader of Victoria Island. Aran went to the
            Bowman
            Instructional School, where she found that Baroq the Master of Disguise had knocked out Athena and was
            reading
            the
            letter.

            After Aran defeated him and saved Athena, she took the letter to Tru, who found that it was completely
            unreadable. They
            realized that it was written in code, and that since Baroq had already read it, the Black Wings likely
            already
            knew the
            contents of the letter. Tru told Aran that Lilin would be able to decipher it, and so Aran went to Rien and
            showed the
            letter to her. Lilin realized that the code was extremely complicated, with several layers of encryption.
            She
            asked Aran
            for some time to decipher it and told her to focus on training in the meantime.</p>

          <h3>The Seal Stone of Ereve</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Lilin told Aran that she had successfully deciphered the letter, which she learned had been
            written by the
            Heroes and given to Athena Pierce in order to pass on to the new Empress of Maple World. She told Aran that
            the letter
            simply said to take care of the Seal Stone of Ereve. As the Black Wings had read the letter, they likely
            knew
            of the
            Seal Stone's existence, and so Lilin asked Aran to warn the people of Ereve and told her to bring the letter
            as proof.
            Aran went to Ereve and met with Neinheart, who was surprised that Aran knew about the Seal Stone of Ereve,
            which was
            also known as Shinsoo's Teardrop. Nevertheless, he told Aran to leave, as not only was Ereve closed to
            foreigners, but
            he also didn't trust that Aran wasn't one of the Black Wings herself.

            Some time later, the Black Wings conducted an operation to try to steal the Seal Stone of Ereve. Baroq used
            his powers
            to disguise himself and infiltrate the island, but thanks to Aran's timely warning, Neinheart was prepared
            and
            mobilized
            the Cygnus Knights, who forced Baroq to retreat. Soon after, Neinheart asked Aran to come to Ereve. There,
            he
            personally
            thanked her for her actions and explained that he had initially mistrusted Aran because of her strange aura,
            but after
            thoroughly investigating her, he now understood her dynamic past.</p>

          <h3>Birth of an Alliance</h3>
          <p>Lilin contacted Aran and asked her to return to Rien. There, she excitedly showed Aran the invitation that
            the
            Cygnus
            Knights had given her and explained that it was proof that Ereve had recognized Aran as a true hero.
            Believing
            it best
            that Aran went with someone who recognized her as a hero, Lilin suggested that she ask Athena Pierce to
            accompany her,
            as she was a well-respected figure in Maple World.

            Aran asked Lilin if she would also come to the conference, but Lilin was unsure about whether she ought to
            be
            there.
            While she debated about going, Athena agreed to accompany Aran and told her that Mercedes would also be
            there.
            As Aran
            had lost her memories, she asked Athena who Mercedes was, to which she merely told Aran that Mercedes was a
            friend. Soon
            after, Lilin told Aran that she would come with them as well.

            After receiving unanimous confirmations, the First Continental Conference took place and the Maple Alliance
            was
            officially created.</p>

          <h3>Fourth Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>As Aran continued her training, Lilin reached out and asked her to return to Rien, as Maha was behaving
            strangely. Aran
            rushed back to Rien and found that Maha was emanating dark energy. He explained that he had been frozen over
            the
            centuries, just as she had been, and that that the absence from his master had been too much for him, which
            had caused
            seeds of darkness to be planted in his heart. Though he had initially believed that the darkness would have
            gone away
            after Aran returned, Maha realized that its hold was too strong on him.

            He begged Aran to defeat him and return him back to normal before he went berserk. Aran then fought Maha and
            managed to
            subdue him. Maha thanked her for her help and explained that since she had proven herself to be strong
            enough
            to contain
            him, it was an indication that he could safely restore her full power. He then bestowed all her old skills
            and
            explained
            that she would return to full power once she fully mastered them.</p>

          <h3>The Adolescent Wolf</h3>
          <p>Soon after, Pucci reached out to her and asked if her wolf, Werewolf, which Aran had renamed Ryko, had been
            acting
            rebellious lately. He explained that wolves went through a type of puberty during their adolescent years,
            and
            that the
            ones who didn't go through puberty failed to grow properly. In order to get advice about how to help Ryko
            through his
            adolescence, Aran first visited Nanuke at Snowy Whale's Island, who offered to make a special formula for
            adolescent
            wolves.

            After bringing her Lime Powder Bottles, Ink Bottles, Butter-Toasted Squids, and special Puberty Wolf
            Vitamins
            from
            Kenta, Nanuke prepared the formula for her, which she then fed to Ryko. Aran then went to see Scadur, who
            told
            her that
            she needed to let Ryko run wild in order to get the rebellion out of his system. After bonding with Ryko by
            riding with
            him through the cold fields of El Nath, Ryko soon grew to become an adolescent wolf.</p>

          <h3>Temple of Time</h3>
          <p>While exploring the Temple of Time, Aran's memories were drained by Dodo. After being told by the Record
            Keeper to
            return to where her adventure began, Aran decided to return to Rien and spoke with Lilin, who explained that
            the whole
            process of seeing Aran having lost her memories, but still keeping her spirit as a hero, as well as her
            gradually
            regaining her abilities, was a memory for her.</p>

          <h3>The Silver Wolf</h3>
          <p>After a long time, Pucci told Aran that a pack of wolves had shown up in Rien, having followed the rumors
            that
            she had
            picked up a lost wolf pup. Aran went to see the Head Wolf, who thanked her for taking care of Ryko, but
            asked
            that she
            return him back. Aran told him that Ryko was her friend, and so she couldn't give him up. In order to
            determine whether
            Aran was worthy of keeping Ryko, the Head Wolf administered a test to have Aran fight his Wolf Underlings.

            After she defeated them all, the Head Wolf was impressed by her power and allowed her to keep Ryko. However,
            he told her
            that they were Silver Wolves, who possessed Silver Blood. He explained that before becoming adults, Silver
            Wolves
            strengthened their hearts by drinking Life Water for Wolves, which was only found in their homeland. He
            warned
            that
            forgoing the ritual would result in serious consequences, and so Aran traveled to Leafre, the homeland of
            the
            Silver
            Wolves, and collected the Life Water for Wolves from the Skelegons, which Ryko then drank in order to evolve
            into an
            adult.</p>

          <h3>The Wolf's Evolution</h3>
          <p>Maha told her that he could sense an incredible force trailing her and asked if there was someone extremely
            powerful
            with her. Aran returned to Rien and Maha immediately recognized that the energy was coming from Ryko, who
            had
            grown
            strong as a Silver Wolf alongside its master. He told her that the wolf was ready for its awakening, but
            when
            Aran told
            him that she didn't remember how to do it, Maha used his powers to awaken the wolf for her. He then told her
            that Ryko
            was the strongest wolf in history, even stronger than the one that she had ridden centuries ago. He
            explained
            that the
            wolf that she had ridden in the past was also called Ryko, and that he had thought that she had given him
            the
            same name
            deliberately.</p>

          <h3>Final Quest</h3>
          <p>
            Maha reached out to Aran through their mental link and asked her to return to Rien. There, he told her that
            though she
            still didn't have all her memories, she was worthy of receiving his blessing, which signified the full
            return
            of her
            powers.</p>

          <h3>Fifth Job Advancement</h3>
          <p>
            Upon entering the Erda Flow and meeting with the Goddess of Maple World, the Goddess asks the player what it
            is that
            they cherish most in the world. Aran gets to choose between the other Heroes or Lilin.</p>
